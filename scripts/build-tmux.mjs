/**
 * Build the BUNDLED tmux that ships inside the macOS app (`<app>/Contents/Resources/bin/tmux`).
 *
 * WHY: without tmux on the machine the app silently degrades to a plain shell — terminals don't
 * survive a restart, the mobile companion can't attach, and a park/offscreen dispose kills the
 * shell AND whatever agent CLI is running in it instead of merely detaching a client (issue #126).
 * A tmux-less user could only fix that by installing tmux themselves. Shipping one removes the
 * whole failure class from the default install.
 *
 * PRECEDENCE (see src/core/tmux-hint.ts `bundledTmuxPath` and pty-manager's `findTmux`): the
 * SYSTEM tmux still wins; this binary is the LAST candidate. A tmux client must be able to talk to
 * the tmux SERVER already running on the user's machine, and pairing a newer bundled client with an
 * older running server fails outright ("server version is too old"). System-first means existing
 * tmux users see literally no change; the bundle only rescues the population that had none.
 *
 * The OUTPUT (resources/bin/tmux) is gitignored — this script is the source of truth. The release
 * job runs it before electron-builder, which copies it in via `extraResources`.
 *
 * Shape of the build: static libevent and static utf8proc (so the app never depends on a Homebrew
 * dylib that isn't there), ncurses taken dynamically from macOS itself (/usr/lib/libncurses.dylib
 * ships with the OS — vendoring terminfo would be a second, larger problem), one `lipo` pass to
 * make the two arch builds universal. No npm dependencies on purpose: node stdlib + the system
 * curl/cc/make/lipo, so the release runner needs nothing installed beyond the Xcode command line
 * tools — in particular no cmake, no autoconf, no pkg-config and no Rosetta.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/build-tmux.mjs [--force] [--verbose]
