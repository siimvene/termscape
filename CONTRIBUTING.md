# Contributing to nodeterm

Thanks for looking. This file is the short door: enough to get running, plus the house rules that
actually get a pull request sent back. The long version — every subsystem and the reasoning behind
its invariants — lives in `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root plus the per-subsystem rule files under
`.claude/rules/`, which are also loaded automatically if you work with an AI coding agent (the root
on every session, each rule file when a source file it covers is read).

nodeterm is licensed **BUSL-1.1** (converts to MIT after four years — see `LICENSE`). Contributions
are accepted under that license.

## Getting set up

```bash
npm install        # also patches + rebuilds node-pty against Electron's ABI (postinstall)
npm run dev        # dev mode with renderer HMR
npm run typecheck  # tsc for both the node and web projects — the fastest correctness gate
npm test           # vitest, unit + integration
```

On Windows, run `bootstrap-windows.bat` instead of `npm install`. It verifies the Visual Studio
C++ workload and its separately installed Spectre-mitigated libraries before compiling `node-pty`.
It also shields MSVC addon builds from the clang/lld ThinLTO settings inherited from Node 26; a
plain `npm install` under a stock Node 26 with node-gyp 12 otherwise fails with `LNK1117`.

`npm run server:dev` boots the Server Edition (browser UI) if you are working on that surface.

**If `src/main/node-pty-patch.test.ts` is red, your `node_modules` is unpatched — not your code.**
Run `npm run rebuild`. node-pty 1.1.0 leaks a pty device per spawn on macOS
([node-pty#950](https://github.com/microsoft/node-pty/issues/950)) and, on Windows, leaves a
conhost alive per killed session (its exit thread deletes the ConPTY baton without closing the
HPCON); we patch both sources before `electron-rebuild` compiles them, and that test guards the
patches surviving upgrades.

## Where code goes

The repo is split by Electron process boundary and the split is enforced, not advisory:

| Directory | What lives there |
|---|---|
| `src/core/` | Electron-free service core. Talks to its shell only through `CorePlatform`. |
| `src/main/` | The Electron shell around `src/core` — windows, IPC, dialogs. |
| `src/server/` | The Server Edition shell (browser UI over WS-RPC). |
| `src/preload/` | The only bridge: `contextBridge` exposing `window.nodeTerminal`. |
| `src/renderer/` | React UI. Reaches main *only* through `window.nodeTerminal`. |
| `src/shared/` | Types and IPC channel names imported by all sides. |

`src/core/no-electron.test.ts` and `src/server/no-electron.test.ts` fail if `src/core` or
`src/server` import `electron` or `../main/*`.

**Put new service logic in `src/core` behind `CorePlatform`, not inline in `src/main`.** That is the
seam the Server Edition boots from; logic left in `src/main` silently does not exist there, and the
boundary tests cannot tell you a feature is *missing*. This keeps happening to the same subsystem:
the ⌘M transcript read and then the context meter's `context:ensure` both shipped desktop-only, and
in both cases the browser cast the message into the void and the feature just looked empty. If your
handler needs something only Electron has (an SSH ControlMaster, a native dialog), make that an
**injected dep** whose absence is a documented degrade — see `registerTranscriptIpc` /
`registerContextEnsureIpc` — rather than a reason to keep the whole handler in `src/main`.

**Windows agent messaging:** direct ConPTY terminals are looked up by the runtime node index,
not the persistence key. `NativeWindowsPane` checks console membership, the unambiguous native
process chain and process birth times, and frames paste only after the terminal requested it.
Do not replace that read with a stored `agentId` or the restart heuristic's deepest descendant.
An interpreter such as `node` is named by its script's package `bin` entry, never as `node`, so
npm-installed CLIs such as Codex are recognized. A session released by park expiry or offscreen
release is still messageable: existence and routing ask the backend, not the attached client.
Never put the submitting Enter in the same write as a message paste: `core/settled-submit.ts`
pastes, waits for the envelope to render, then submits separately, on every backend.
The persistent session-host transport has its own versioned messaging extension: the host checks
its session generation, OS process identity and emulator before writing. An older live host keeps
its terminals and refuses the extension; never restart it automatically or fall back to sendKeys.
Message dispatch publishes pending canvas edits before main resolves scope, without overwriting
an unresolved file conflict. See `docs/windows-session-host.md`.

Claude usage identity is scoped to the same config directory as its credentials. Read organization
metadata even when credentials already include an email, and degrade to the email-only row when
metadata cannot be read. Managed usage must never fall back to an unscoped system Keychain token:
that would label one account's limits with another account's organization.

Context-link maps authorize reads. Publish changes to edges, linked metadata, and background
projects independently of canvas geometry updates; a debounce reset by every node render can
starve publication indefinitely. Only merge projects owned by the same core, and use the rendered
canvas's project epoch during tab switches. Core must revoke removed links before asynchronous
transcript discovery or debug-file writes finish; an older write must never restore that access.
Coalesce renderer updates before building the workspace map, without resetting the scheduled task.
Intermediate publications retain resolved transcript paths only for unchanged identities; changing
a session/account/location/hook path or removing the target invalidates that cache immediately.

Windows installer safety (#829): `build/installer.nsh` overrides NSIS's process-killing check.
A running app or session host blocks install/uninstall, and a failed process query blocks too.
Never restore automatic host termination: quitting the app preserves those live sessions.
Update preparation must keep saved canvas nodes: exit programs normally, quit, then have the user
verify and stop any remaining host. Never recommend **End session** (it deletes nodes). Cold agent
resume depends on supported, saved conversation history; it does not preserve running tasks.
See `docs/windows-session-host.md` for the user-controlled preparation/recovery steps and limits.

**Prepare for update** (#829 step 2, Windows only): ⌘K / the update card run
`components/PrepareUpdateDialog.tsx` over the pure `lib/updatePrep.ts` plan. It refuses while any
session's agent is working or waiting on the user (renderer store OR core mirror — unmounted nodes
have no renderer state), asks idle mounted agents to `/exit` through `registerAgentUpdateExit`,
confirms what still stops (Cancel focused), then sends the host's `shutdown` command and quits only
once the host process is confirmed gone. `shutdown` is a negotiated hello feature: never send it to
a host that did not advertise it, and never add a taskkill/name-kill fallback — an older host gets
the manual steps. The flow never deletes a node. Server Edition: degraded stub (`unsupported`).

Staged host runtime (#829 step 3): a packaged Windows build launches the host from a private
copy, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\nodeterm\session-host\<version>-<fingerprint>\nodeterm-sessionhost-v2.exe`
(`src/core/session-host-runtime.ts`), so it maps no installed file and no longer blocks updates.
Rules: a copy is launched only after it was published by one rename of a hash-verified,
smoke-tested temp dir (marker written last); the image name must stay unlike `nodeterm.exe` /
`nodeterm-session-host.exe` (old uninstallers match those by name machine-wide); every staging
failure falls back to the legacy in-install-dir launch, which the preflight still blocks on; old
copies are deleted only after a SUCCESSFUL process query shows nothing runs from them and the
directory can be renamed aside. The host protocol stays additive-only — an older host is kept and
used, an incompatible one is left running and reported, never killed.

## Three surfaces

A feature is not done until you have decided how it behaves on each — even if the decision is "not
applicable here":

1. **Desktop** (Electron)
2. **Server Edition** (Linux, browser)
3. **Mobile companion** — *nodeterm mobile*, two **private** repos: `nodeterm-ios` (SwiftUI) and
   `eneskirca/nodeterm-android` (Kotlin, in development). You cannot open a PR against either, so
   this is normally a follow-up note rather than same-PR work: say in your PR what the mobile side
   would need, and **mention @eneskirca** so it gets picked up there. "Not applicable" is a fine
   answer — just make it a stated one. Never assume the phone is an iPhone in desktop copy or
   defaults.

Anything reachable from `window.nodeTerminal` needs a **real** implementation in
`src/renderer/bridge/`, or a deliberate, documented degrade. The `satisfies NodeTerminalApi` gate
forces you to *declare* every member, but a no-op stub compiles fine while doing nothing.

The **canvas and the kanban board are two views of the same nodes.** When you add something to a
canvas node — a header action, a badge, a menu item — ask whether the board's card and card modal
need it too, and wire it in the same change. The global (Omni) board shows all open projects as
stacked swimlanes; it is off by default (`settings.omniKanbanEnabled`), has a dedicated remappable
shortcut (`view.globalKanbanToggle`), and can be made the default for Cmd+Shift+B via
`settings.omniKanbanAsDefault` — see CLAUDE.md for the full invariants.

A board card's **source** is a registry entry, not a branch you add at a call site
(`renderer/lib/kanbanSources.ts`). Declare the source once — filter label, `placement`
(`assignment` = the board's own persisted assignments, `provider` = the provider owns the column),
in-column `lane` order, whether it is `configured` for a board, whether it is `readOnly` (the
board never writes it: no drag, no move control) — and give it its one leaf (a card component and
the list path feeding it). Columns take lanes and name no source; the drag path branches on
`placement`. If you find yourself writing `=== 'github'` outside the registry, the registry is
missing a field.

A board feature has to say which of three tiers it lives in: a **board fact** is shared content
in `project.kanban` (`.nodeterm/project.json`) — optional, sanitized in `sanitizeKanban`
(`core/workspace-files.ts`, which every load and save seam runs) and harmless to an older build;
a **display preference** is per-user localStorage (`state/kanbanDisplay.ts`); a filter on **live
agent state** is component state and is never persisted. An unanchored card move lands at the TOP
of its column; only a positional drop asks for the bottom (`AT_COLUMN_END`). Card order is a
`rank` string, and every write — renderer or core — goes through `placeAssignment`
(`@shared/kanban-order`), which also keeps the assignments ARRAY in rank order for builds that
ignore `rank`; never splice the array by hand. A saved view's query is built only by `viewQuery`,
so the live-state chips can never be saved into one. Board keys are
registry commands in the `board` scope — the only scope allowed a bare letter, because it never
fires while typing or in a terminal.

Anything that **starts an agent by itself** (board dispatch is the first) takes its consent from
machine-local settings and its trigger from a gesture the person made in this app — never from a
label, a column or a file that can arrive from GitHub or a `git pull` — and its consent binds what
it consented to (board dispatch binds repository + column title + label, not a bare column id).
Board dispatch's one trigger is `KanbanView.moveIssueByUser` → `onIssueMoved` → `decideDispatch`,
and a run starts only through `dispatchStart`, from that decision or from the queue drain after
`recheckQueued`; `lib/board-dispatch.guard.test.ts` fails if a new caller of any link in that
chain appears, or if anything but `dispatchOnUserMove` creates a queued entry.

A card chip that reads agent state subscribes to a **primitive signature** of the nodes it shows
(`teamProgressSig`, `issueRunChipSig`), never to the whole `agentStatus.byId` map — that map changes
on every hook event of every node. A field of `agentStatus` that is persisted across a restart is restored
as a record of the past, never as live state: `lastSeen` orders and ages sidebar rows but never
becomes `state` or Eco's idle clock (`lastEventAt`). Before a card shows a fact, check that its place on the board
does not already say it (`lib/cardRedundancy.ts`); the card modal keeps every fact the card drops.
`project.ropes` / `bridges` are hostile input like the board: they are admitted through
`sanitizeLinks` on every load and save seam, and a reader still tolerates anything. A wait rope
(`--after`, the verify panel) is minted with `waitRopeId` (`ctrl-after-<dep>-<node>`), never with the
opener's `ctrl-<source>-<node>` shape: rope ORDER does not survive the canvas pruning ropes to
deleted nodes, so the id is the only thing that tells a wait from an opener. A node opened by a
control verb also RECORDS its opener (`data.openedBy`); readers that ask "who opened this"
(`stationsByOpener`, the station-failure notice) prefer that record and still require the opener's
rope to exist.

Before adding a GitHub read, check what the existing poll already fetches. Pull request cards
needed no new request at all: `/repos/{repo}/issues` returns pull requests, and the client used to
discard them. `/repos/{repo}/pulls` looks like the obvious endpoint and is the expensive one — it
**ignores `since`**, so it can reuse none of the incremental machinery, and its items are ~3.5× the
bytes. CLAUDE.md's kanban section has the measurements and the eviction rule that keeps the issue
lane unaffected.

Three rules for any new GitHub call (CLAUDE.md's kanban section, "Sync foundation", has the why):
- **Never decide what a failure means yourself.** Pass it through `classifyGitHubFailure`
  (`core/github/failure.ts`). Only `unauthorized` may ever read as "signed out"; a rate limit, an
  outage or a dropped connection must say so instead, or the user re-authenticates an account that
  is fine.
- **Go through the request coordinator and a client built by the host.** That is what feeds every
  response's rate budget to the coordinator, pauses background work below the floor and caps waits.
  A request that bypasses it is invisible to the budget. Prefer a conditional request
  (`If-None-Match`) for anything you poll: a 304 is free.
- **A write whose meaning comes from the project file needs `context.mappingApproved`.** The column
  mapping is git-shared; approval covers it, and reads do not need it.
- **Only a completed scan moves the incremental cursor.** `lastSuccessfulRefreshAt` is the next
  scan's `since`; a write that folds one issue into the snapshot must leave it alone, or other
  people's changes from before the write wait for the daily full pass.
- **GraphQL spends a different budget.** GitHub meters `graphql` apart from `core`; ask the
  coordinator with the resource (`throttle(identity, now, 'graphql')`) and let a primary limit carry
  its `resource`, or a spent GraphQL budget stalls REST issue sync. A GraphQL field the token may
  not read comes back `null` plus a FORBIDDEN error — decode that as "hidden", never as its empty
  value (a null check rollup alone means "no checks").

Do not add a field inside `ProjectKanban.meta[]` entries: every card-meta setter (assignees, due,
priority, labels, the phone's label verb) rebuilds the entry from a fixed list and silently drops
anything else. Board-level fields survive every transform — `pullLinks` is one.

## House rules

- **The Pro gate stays on by default.** The fork's self-host bypass in `src/core/license.ts`
  (`SELF-HOST UNGATE`) is a build-time opt-in: `TERMSCAPE_UNGATE=1` in the build environment,
  baked in by the bundlers. Never flip the default, never read the flag at runtime, and never
  publish an installer built with it as anything other than a personal build. The Licensor's
  consent to this fork being public rests on that. `license.test.ts` (upstream's, verbatim) and
  `license.ungate.test.ts` cover both halves.

- **A canvas-control verb never switches the active project.** An agent in a background project
  is answered from that project's serialized store (`ControlSurface` in `Canvas.tsx`); sessions it
  opens are cold-armed and start when the user next views that project. If a verb genuinely
  cannot run against the store, add it to `LIVE_ONLY_VERBS` (`src/renderer/lib/controlRouting.ts`)
  so it is refused with a message — never call `switchProject`/`reopenProject`/`setActive` from
  the control handler. `control-no-travel.source.test.ts` fails your PR if you do.

- **Branch labels describe a checkout on one core.** Share existing status reads through
  `renderer/state/gitBranches.ts`; do not cache a branch forever by project id or copy a project
  branch onto worktree nodes. Source, Sessions and worktree headers consume the same observations,
  keyed by API identity, exact cwd and (for SSH) project identity. Never probe an SSH cwd locally
  from a background header: only the active SSH project is git-routable. SSH headers observe
  Source refreshes instead.

- **A port is a node's only if its listener is in that node's process tree.** Dev-server
  discovery (`core/dev-ports.ts`) attributes ports by socket ownership and never connects to
  anything. A new consumer reads the scan, it does not add a probe. A forward
  (`core/remote-ssh/port-forward.ts`) binds `127.0.0.1` only, keeps the same port number or
  refuses with the reason — a different local port is only ever the person's explicit choice — and
  never forwards a port below 1024 unasked. The renderer passes a node and a port, never an address:
  core re-scans and decides the host-side target. Treat `ss`/`lsof`/`ls` output as attacker-
  influenced text: a process name is chosen by the process, so parse each owner group on its own and
  never let a name reach a pid (see CLAUDE.md → Dev-server ports).

- **A GitHub issue reaches a pane only as a validated reference.** Issue titles and bodies are
  written by strangers on public repositories, and a launch line is typed into a shell. Anything
  that starts or instructs an agent about an issue goes through `@shared/github-issue-ref`:
  `issueLaunchPrompt` (the only composer, which re-validates `owner/repo#N` itself) for text, and
  `normalizeIssueRef` wherever a stored `issueRef` is read — it comes from a git-shared file. Never
  interpolate `issue.title`/`issue.body` into a prompt, and never add a path that posts an agent's
  output to GitHub on its own: posting is public, and only the user asks for it.

- **A comment in the board log is text, never a trigger.** A board comment that @mentions a session
  is delivered to that agent (`deliverBoardCommentFromUi`, through the ordinary agent-messaging
  gates) only from the comment composer's send, with the text the user just typed, in the desktop
  app's own window. The log is a shared file — a git pull, another instance, a relay peer or a
  team-presence guest can put a mention token into it — so nothing that loads, reloads or renders it
  may reach a delivery. `board-comment-trigger.guard.test.ts` fails on a second call site, and the
  IPC is a raw main-window-only `ipcMain` handler (never on the peer-dispatchable platform table).

- **Hook decision JSON is built in core, never in the renderer or the script.** To answer a held
  Claude permission request with more than `allow`/`deny` (a plan's follow-on mode, a question's
  answers), send a `PermissionAnswer` through `answerPermission`; `core/agents/permission-decision.ts`
  validates it against the pending request file on the agent's host and writes the JSON. The managed
  hook prints a JSON answer only after a strict prefix/size/one-line check, so a new decision shape
  must pass `isBoundedAnswerContent` or it is silently ignored. Answer content never goes on an argv.
  See `docs/hook-reply-approvals.md`.

- **Never call the user's machine a Mac in user-visible copy.** Use `thisMachine()` /
  `thisMachineCap()` / `machineNoun()` from `src/renderer/lib/machineName.ts` — "this Mac" on
  macOS, "this PC" on Windows, "this computer" elsewhere and in any Server Edition browser tab
  (where the machine being described is the SERVER, whose OS the viewer cannot know). Issue #563:
  ~30 strings said "this Mac", including *"This Mac is not authorized on this license"* and *"a
  teammate on a seat can run commands on this Mac"* — the one sentence a user has to trust before
  handing out shell access. `machineName.guard.test.ts` scans non-comment lines and will fail your
  PR; copy that really is macOS-specific (the ptmx-limit banner, the notch step) is exempt by name
  with its reason. Comments are not scanned.

- **Bottom canvas pills must leave room for the measured dock.** `CanvasPills` bounds their row
  and moves it above the dock when the side budget is too small. Only usage summary text may
  truncate; keep refresh outside that overflow and keep the row free of stacking contexts so
  popovers can still clear the sidebar/board. `scripts/usage-layout.test.ts` verifies real Chrome
  layout and hit targets (set `CHROME_BIN` when Chrome is not at the Linux default path).

- **An overlay you lay over a live terminal steals its wheel — give it `pointer-events: none`.**
  Wheel routing is a per-packet hit test on `closest('.nowheel')` (ours in `Canvas.tsx`, and React
  Flow's own `panOnScroll` independently), so the element under the pointer decides, not the node.
  `.term-node__xterm` carries the class and covers the whole body, so a banner drawn ON a running
  terminal takes those pixels out of the terminal's wheel area and hands them to the canvas — the
  user scrolls and the canvas slides instead. `.term-node__upload` and `.term-copy-pill` were
  already `pointer-events: none` for this; `.term-node__stalecwd` was not (issue #767), and
  `canvas/terminal-wheel-boundary.test.ts` now fails on the next one. An overlay that REPLACES a
  dead view keeps the canvas wheel on purpose — there is nothing underneath to scroll. Same rule
  one layer up: do not "fix" a routing question by moving `nowheel` outward, because a second
  consumer reads the class and no per-element opt-out can reach it. Deep version: CLAUDE.md §
  Terminal node lifecycle.

- **The node colour palette is ONE list, and it is also the control boundary.**
  `src/shared/node-colors.ts` is what every picker draws and what `nodeterm color --color C`
  validates against — so a colour the UI offers and a colour the CLI accepts cannot drift apart.
  Its agent section is DERIVED from `AGENT_CONFIG`, never re-typed: add a builtin agent and the
  palette grows by itself. If you are adding a surface that lets someone choose a node colour,
  render `<NodeColorSwatches>` rather than mapping the array yourself (a guard test fails on a
  hand-rolled swatch row) — and if the value will be drawn as TEXT or as an opaque fill under
  white, take `SYSTEM_NODE_COLOR_SWATCHES` instead, with the contrast reason in a comment. Deep
  version, including the measured numbers: CLAUDE.md § Node colors.

- **The Antigravity hook is a gate in front of every `agy` tool call on the machine — treat its
  stdout as a decision.** `agy` reads hook stdout as JSON and our hook, in the global
  `~/.gemini/config/hooks.json`, is subscribed to `PreToolUse`. Measured: silence runs the tool, but
  `{}`, any stray non-JSON byte and a non-zero exit DENY it — in nodeterm and in the user's own
  terminals. So: change answers only in `antigravity-decision.ts` (the one table); print nothing
  after the answer; keep the Windows command free of quotes (agy escapes them as `\"`, which cmd.exe
  cannot read) and test Windows dispatch WITHOUT `windowsVerbatimArguments`; keep the `AutoRun`
  refusal. Deep version: `docs/antigravity-agent.md` and CLAUDE.md § Agent support.

- **Finding `agy` for hook installation is not enough to launch it.** The measured Windows
  installer wrote `%LOCALAPPDATA%\agy\bin` into a `REG_SZ` user PATH, so command lookup kept the
  percent expression literal and `agy` was not found even though its executable existed. Local
  Antigravity PTYs therefore APPEND the directory returned by the same vendor-location lookup the
  hook installer uses, and only when no PATH entry already names it (`pathWithAgyDir`) — never
  prepend: on macOS/Linux agy lives in a shared directory, and moving it ahead of the user's entries
  shadows their own tools. Keep that correction scoped to Antigravity sessions and out of SSH
  sessions. (The separate Windows `Path`→`PATH` key fix-up applies to every Windows spawn.)

- **Our hooks.json bundle is the user's to switch off.** `"enabled": false` on `nodeterm-status` in
  `~/.gemini/config/hooks.json` is agy's own switch and nodeterm's only opt-out; the installer
  carries it across every rewrite. hooks.json is published through the shared settings transaction
  (`updateSettingsFile`) — never a bare write, which replaced a symlinked file with a regular one.

- **Every loosening of a security gate must be a SETTING the user can see and revoke.** A "don't
  ask again" that lives only in a dialog is a permission granted once and never findable again. The
  canvas-control destructive confirm is the pattern to copy (`@shared/control-confirm`): a CANCEL
  never grants anything, a waived action still announces itself on screen and NAMES the waiver that
  let it through, and which gates may be waived at all is a TABLE, not an `if` at each call site —
  so "this one can never be waived" is a tested fact rather than a line somebody forgot to write.
  **What a dialog may grant is bounded by SCOPE, not by permanence.** It offers "while nodeterm is
  running" (in-memory — not `settings.json`, not `localStorage`, so quitting restores the gate) or
  "always in this project" (machine-local, keyed by project id, pruned like
  `settings.sidebarCollapsedItems`). The machine-WIDE waiver stays Settings-only, because that is
  the one a stray click in a dialog that appeared under the user's hands must not be able to grant.
  Offering only the app-run one was its own failure: it is not what a user who ticks "don't ask
  again" means, so the real choices were "be asked forever" or "turn it off everywhere". Two rules
  come with the project scope: it is keyed on the project the call ACTS ON (canvas control routes
  by source, so that is often not the project on screen), and it is machine-local — never
  `.nodeterm/project.json`, which is git-shared, or a cloned repo could switch someone's confirms
  off.

- **An agent may only reach settings through an ALLOWLIST, and every change asks.** The
  canvas-control `settings` verb (`src/shared/settings-verb.ts`) reads and asks to change a short
  table of keys; anything off the table is refused by name, and a forbidden set (permission modes,
  accounts/credentials, node identity, browser control, telemetry, keybindings, confirm waivers)
  outranks the table — its test walks the table against the set AND a name pattern, so an entry that
  would let an agent grant itself a power goes red even when added on purpose. `settings` is outside
  `CONFIRM_WAIVABLE_VERBS`: a CLI that could waive its own confirm would make the confirm decorative.
  A capability change must land through the UI's own setter (`setProjectCapability`: file flag AND
  this machine's `'kept'` answer), never a hand-rolled flag write. Adding a key is one line in the
  table plus a `why`. The Server Edition has no dialog, so it refuses every `--set` by name.

- **A permission mode (or anything else) that rides `project.json` is GIT-SHARED — never key a
  local gate on it alone.** `project.defaultPermissionMode` travels to everyone who clones the
  repo, so binding a confirmation-skip to "the mode is bypassPermissions" would let a cloned
  repository silently switch off a user's destructive-action gate. The rule that came out of it:
  ask `resolvePermissionModeWithSource` WHO chose the value (`project` / `global` / `default`) and
  act only on the user's own machine-local choice — and keep `default` distinct from `global`,
  because reading an unset setting as a deliberate choice is reading consent into silence. Anything
  machine-local goes in `settings.json`; nothing that grants a capability goes in `project.json`.
  A machine-local DEFAULT for a project capability (`agentMessagingDefault`) is allowed only because
  it answers ABSENCE: an explicit `true` in `project.json` still needs this machine's recorded
  answer, an explicit `false` still wins, and "off" must therefore be written as a literal `false`.
  Read grants through `projectCapabilityGrantedFor(project, cap, settings)` — never the file bit.

- **Nothing an agent asks for may take the user's screen.** Canvas control routes by SOURCE: the
  request names the agent's own node, and the dispatch has to find the canvas that owns it. For
  years "that canvas is not on screen" was answered by switching the project tab — so a background
  agent's `close` moved a user who was typing in another project, applied that project's saved
  viewport, and took their camera and typing focus for a call they did not make. Every verb now has
  a decided off-screen behaviour (`src/shared/control-off-screen.ts`) and none of them is "travel":
  it is answered against the owning project's serialized nodes, or REFUSED with a reason the agent
  can act on. If you add a verb, give it an entry — a refusal beats a hijack, and a verb with no
  entry falls into the generic refusal, which is fail-closed but is nobody's decision. Two traps
  the old shape hid: a verb body that resolves `--node` against the live `nodesRef.current` while
  answering for another project silently acts on whatever the human is looking at (use
  `ctlNodes()`), and reading `activeProjectId` inside a verb has the same bug (use `ctlProject`).
  The guard is `test/acceptance/control-verb-disposition.test.ts`, which walks main's verb table
  against the renderer's dispositions — deliberately cross-layer, because that is the only way
  "every verb" is checked rather than remembered.

- **A canvas-control verb that creates something must be safe to retry.** An agent whose reply
  was lost (its tool call timed out, the tunnel dropped) runs the same command again, and the
  shim's endpoint walk re-posts on its own. The hook server's `/control/` route — the one place
  desktop main and the Server Edition both sit behind — keys a ledger on (verified caller node,
  request id) and replays the first reply instead of running the call twice
  (`src/core/control-request-ledger.ts`). A new verb that opens a node, a team, a worktree or a frame
  joins `REQUEST_ID_VERBS` in the same PR; the agent-facing text renders from that set. A handler
  that gives up before it knows whether its effect happened answers `indeterminate: true`, never a
  plain failure that says "safe to retry" — the retry would then open a second one. Anything desktop
  main does with a renderer answer belongs in its `finishAnswer` step, which the forwarder also runs
  on a LATE answer (the one a retry is replayed): post-processing written after the `await` instead
  runs only on time. Do not move the ledger into one shell's handler: the other shell silently loses
  it.

- **A new way to hand a station work must feed `src/core/station-handover.ts`.** Plain `--after`
  would otherwise release a dependent on the station's `done` from its PREVIOUS task. Today the
  hand-overs are `send` / `reply` (through the messaging layer's `onHandover`) and `write` / `run`
  (`noteControlAnswer` in each shell's control handler — desktop main's `finishAnswer` and the
  Server Edition wrapper). A new verb that types a task into another node's pane joins that set in
  the same PR, on BOTH shells; `src/main/station-handover-wiring.test.ts` pins the sites that exist.

- **A new canvas-control open path must record who opened the node.** When a station stops, the
  agent that opened it is told (`src/core/agents/station-notice.ts`) — and a rope alone cannot say
  who that is, because an `--after` node is roped to the stations it waited on too, with the same id
  shape. So every open verb stamps `data.openedBy` where it draws the opener's rope
  (`lib/stationOpener.ts`; the live paths get it from `connect`, the off-canvas and cold-open writes
  call `withOpenedBy` themselves). An open path that ropes without stamping compiles and passes, and
  its stations fail in silence; `src/main/station-notice-wiring.test.ts` pins the sites that exist.
  The notice text is app-authored and fixed — never add anything the STATION wrote to it (its
  output is exactly where an injection aimed at the orchestrator would come from).

- **A location from `.nodeterm/settings.json` is hostile input.** That file is committed to the
  repository, so anyone who can commit wrote it. A worktree location it produces must pass
  `sharedWorktreeLocationRefusal` (`src/shared/worktree-location.ts`) on every create path, and
  every `git worktree add` passes the real-path backstop in `GitService.worktreeAdd`. If you add
  another setting that names a place on disk the app will WRITE to, give it the same two layers:
  a lexical rule keyed on `source: 'shared'`, and a check on real paths where the write happens.

- **A node you just created is not in `nodesRef` yet, and a `setNodes` updater is not "now".**
  `nodesRef` mirrors React state at render time, so a frame made this tick is invisible to the next
  line that looks it up — and an updater runs at RENDER time, after any zustand write may already
  have flushed a render that mirrored `nodesRef` back to a list without it. Compute anything that
  reads `nodesRef` (parenting, a cwd, a position) BEFORE `setNodes`, and when one flow creates a
  frame and a node inside it, do both in one synchronous block (`attachWorktree` writes the new
  frame into `nodesRef` for exactly this). Every worktree creation goes through
  `createBoundWorktree` (`renderer/lib/worktreeCreate.ts`); do not add a fourth copy of
  "`git worktree add`, then bind".

- **A dialog raised on someone else's behalf must know that request's lifetime.** Main abandons a
  canvas-control request after 120 s and tells the renderer nothing, so an unanswered dialog sat
  there forever AND held the one-confirm-at-a-time guard, which refused every later destructive
  verb with "a confirmation is already pending" for the rest of the app run — the agent, told the
  refusal was retryable, retried into it in a loop. If you raise a dialog for a bounded request,
  give it the deadline (`ConfirmState.expiresAt`), import the bound rather than re-typing it, have
  it expire slightly AFTER the requester gives up, and answer with "expired" — never "denied by
  user", which claims a decision the human never made. Reach for the existing
  `useExpiringDialog` hook rather than a second effect: the worktree-removal dialog needed the
  identical rule a day later, and two copies is how one of them quietly misses the next fix. Give
  the deadline only to a dialog an AGENT raised — one the user opened themselves must never vanish
  under them — and remember that clearing a dialog is not always just nulling its state (that one
  also has to release the ref its own busy-guard reads).

- **An error must not name a remedy nobody measured — and the remedy needs its own test.** The
  `unproven-target-owner` refusal told its caller *"Re-open the target node so its owner is
  recorded, then try again"*, and re-opening is precisely the attach that records nothing
  (ownership is recorded only on a genuine fresh spawn), so a caller that obeyed got the identical
  refusal forever. It shipped because no test read the sentence. When you write a refusal, pin its
  claim against the MECHANISM it describes — assert the remedy's precondition by calling the
  function that decides it, so the copy goes red when the behaviour moves — and remember who reads
  it: telling a language model to do something only a human can do is not advice.

- **Anything path-shaped: Windows is a delivery target.** Most of this was written on
  macOS/Linux, so the recurring defect is code that is genuinely correct on POSIX —
  `split('/')`, `startsWith('/')` as an is-absolute test, a bare `fs.rename`. Use
  `path.basename`/`join`/`sep`, publish files with `renameAtomic`, and write at least one test with
  a real `C:\`-shaped input. Guards enforce some of this and will fail your PR. In the Server
  Edition and relay tabs, the browser's OS is NOT the filesystem's OS: obtain the dialect from the
  core that owns the files, and keep an unobserved host unknown rather than guessing. Conversely,
  on POSIX a backslash is legal filename text — do not treat both separators as interchangeable
  unless the owning filesystem is known to be Windows.

- **Anything tmux does for us on POSIX, the session host owes on Windows.** The two delivery paths
  are not symmetric and the missing half fails in the direction that LOOKS like success: `sendText`
  rides `tmux paste-buffer -p` on POSIX, which frames the payload from the pane's real
  bracketed-paste state and submits with a separate `send-keys Enter`; the session host answered the
  same call with one raw `text + '\r'`, so a paste-aware composer swallowed the Enter as pasted
  content and an injected prompt sat there unsubmitted (issue #686). Before adding a delivery, a
  probe or a pane query, check what the tmux leg does with it and write the host's equivalent in the
  same change. The host can usually answer more precisely than tmux, because its headless emulator
  sees the pane app's own bytes — see CLAUDE.md's "We have our own VT emulator" for the one place
  that reasoning is inverted.

- **A new session-host push frame must be negotiated at `hello`, never just sent.** An older
  `SessionHostClient` treats EVERY push frame whose `type` is not `data` as an exit, and a
  long-lived host routinely outlives the app that started it — so a frame the connection did not
  opt into retires a live session. Add the capability to `SESSION_HOST_FEATURES`, send it only to
  sockets that listed it (the `geometry` push of issue #914 is the worked example), and pin that
  against the real bundled host as `session-host/geometry-host.test.ts` does.

- **Finding a Windows executable is not the same as being able to spawn it.** A PATH lookup may
  correctly resolve an npm CLI to `<name>.cmd`, but Node's `execFile`/`spawn` cannot execute that
  shim directly. For short-lived app-owned subprocesses, pass the resolved path and argv through
  `directExecutableInvocation` (`src/core/exec-path.ts`): it uses hidden `cmd.exe` with explicit
  escaping, verbatim arguments and delayed expansion off. Do not fix this with `shell: true`;
  prompts and other user-controlled arguments would become shell syntax. `.bat`/`.ps1`, CR/LF/NUL
  arguments and lines above cmd's limit fail explicitly. Keep stdin direct: PowerShell's text
  pipeline changes Unicode and line endings under Windows PowerShell 5.1.

- **The phone reaches a Windows desktop through the relay only.** Everything the iOS app sends over
  SSH is POSIX sh plus tmux, and Windows OpenSSH hands out `cmd.exe`, so Windows pairing installs no
  SSH key and requires remote access instead of an SSH server (`src/shared/pairing-gate.ts`). Do not
  "fix" this by installing the key into `administrators_authorized_keys`. The phone tries SSH before
  the relay, so a key that works locks it onto a path that cannot work. CLAUDE.md, "Remote access",
  has the details.

- **Phone keys and store links are platform-neutral.** New paired keys are stamped
  `nodeterm-mobile-<id>`, but revoke must keep matching the legacy `nodeterm-ios-<id>` stamp every
  existing iPhone carries (`src/main/pairing-core.ts`). Link to a store only through
  `mobileStoreLinks()` in `src/renderer/lib/links.ts` — the Play link stays hidden behind
  `ANDROID_APP_PUBLISHED` until the listing exists, and a guard test refuses direct store URLs anywhere else in the renderer.

- **Relay pins are per role, and a revoke is one call.** Pin a peer only through its role's store
  in `src/main/remote/approved-devices.ts` (`phonePins` is the only one anything auto-admits from —
  never write a desktop peer there), and revoke only through `src/main/remote/peer-revoke.ts`, which
  unpins AND closes every live session on every host. A new host that serves relay peers must
  `registerPeerSessionKiller`, or revoking a device leaves its shell open. CLAUDE.md, "Remote access".
- **A relay channel that names a project needs a row in `relay-project-scope.ts`.** A relay guest
  bound to one shared project must never reach another, and the jail is keyed on channel class:
  anything named `githubIssues:*`, `board-log:*` or `projects.*` is refused on a scoped session
  unless that table can read its projectId. Add the row in the same PR as the channel, or the verb
  is refused for every scoped guest (and `relay-project-scope.test.ts` goes red telling you so).

- **A new IPC channel a relay tab can call must be classified in `src/core/relay/access-policy.ts`
  — the guard test fails otherwise.** Every `IPC.*` referenced by the relay API's builder
  functions in `src/renderer/bridge/ws-bridge.ts` (the ones the guard's own `BUILDERS` list names)
  and by `src/renderer/bridge/relay-api.ts` goes in `VIEW` or `COMMENT` with its own argument check,
  or in the reviewed `EDITOR_ONLY` set; `src/core/relay/access-policy.guard.test.ts` names every one
  you missed. A NEW builder function must also be added to that `BUILDERS` list, or its channels are
  never scanned. A hosted team's Viewers and Commenters are refused anything unlisted, so
  forgetting is safe but silent, and the guard is what makes someone decide. Opening a channel to
  viewers also means adding it to the renderer's mirror, `src/shared/hosted-access.ts` (the same
  test pins the two lists equal). An EVENT a viewer must receive needs a `VIEW_EVENTS` entry, and no
  test forces that: without one, the event simply never arrives. Deep version: CLAUDE.md § Hosted
  team relay.

- **...and in `src/core/relay/scoped-guest-policy.ts` too.** A Team Access invite that shares ONE
  project is served through that allowlist: every relay-tab channel is in `SCOPED` (with a check
  that its node / path / projectId belongs to the shared project) or in the reviewed
  `SCOPED_REFUSED` set, and `scoped-guest-policy.guard.test.ts` fails on one that is neither. An
  unlisted channel is refused to scoped guests; an event they must receive needs to be attributable
  to the shared project (`filterScopedEvent`). Anything that touches the host's settings,
  credentials, license or pairing belongs in `src/shared/host-control.ts` instead — refused to every
  relay peer.

- **Live links: a new broadcast channel needs nothing, a new per-session pty channel needs a
  decision.** Live-link viewers are quiet clients, so no broadcast ever reaches them. A per-session pty
  event reaches a viewer only once it is added to `watcherEventAllowed`
  (`src/core/watch-link/watcher-policy.ts`) on purpose — and only if its payload is the visible screen,
  never history (why `pty:resync` is refused). Never add link state to a node, a board or a canvas op:
  canvas sync and the canvas authority would publish it. `src/shared/watch-link/` is copied byte for
  byte into the viewer page's repo: import only siblings and `tweetnacl`, write type imports as
  `import type` (`isomorphism.guard.test.ts` fails otherwise), and expect a change there to need a
  re-vendor. A new viewer CAST is refused until `watcherAccess` admits it on purpose, and a Control
  link's typed bytes reach only the node's pane through `PtyManager.controlInput` — never written into a
  tmux client's pty (the prefix would reach tmux) and never on a command line. `docs/live-links.md`.

- **A change to canvas content that does not travel as a `canvas:mut` op is lost on a hosted core —
  route new content edits through the op vocabulary (`src/shared/canvas-content.ts`).** On a Server
  Edition hosting a team, the canvas authority writes a shared project's nodes, edges and board
  from the ops it hears, and overlays every save with that content, so a content change that reaches
  the core only inside a save is dropped from disk. A renderer write into a project that is NOT on
  screen goes through the projects store, whose node and edge writers run inside `ownWrite` so the
  write is cast (`canvas/stored-publish.ts`); a new store writer of that kind must use `ownWrite`
  too. Deep version: CLAUDE.md § Hosted team relay.

- **A request that trusts a relay host key (host-token mint, host-mode push) proves possession
  through `src/core/relay/relay-pop.ts`, and falls back to an unproven request ONLY on a 404/405
  challenge.** One exception, push only: a 200 challenge followed by a 404 from `/v1/push/host-auth`
  (possible only in a backend redeploy window) also posts unproven, and caches that verdict for 10
  minutes; push stops nothing, and the backend gates the post regardless. The push webhook's
  management calls prove the same key through their own protocol (`src/core/push-webhook.ts`) — do
  not fold one into the other. Change the relay protocol and `relay-pop-vector.json` must change in
  both repos. Deep version: CLAUDE.md § Hosted team relay.

- **Normalize BOTH sides of a path comparison, through one function.** A marker normalized where
  it is built and matched raw where it is used is a no-op on the machine you wrote it on and a
  silent defect on Windows. That is issue #558: the managed-hook marker was folded to `/` while
  the stored command still carried `\`, so nodeterm stopped recognizing its own hook entries and
  appended a fresh copy of all nine on every launch — nine hook processes per event, nine
  concurrent 45 s permission waits racing one prompt. Write the normalizer once, use it on both
  sides, and pin it with a `C:\`-shaped test.

- **Orchestration state that must survive a restart goes through `src/core/durable-state.ts`.** The
  delivery queue, station reports and the `--request-id` ledger are mirrored to
  `<userData>/orchestration-state/` by one module: add a `DurableFactSpec` (kind, version, a
  sanitizer that DROPS what it cannot trust, a cap) rather than writing another store. Decide — and
  write in the fact's header — what a restart MEANS for it (a TTL that kept running, a session that
  may have changed), load it at boot in BOTH shells after anything it reads (the status mirror), and
  test it by writing through one instance and reading through a new one. Never put it in
  `.nodeterm/project.json`: it is one machine's run state. CLAUDE.md § Durable orchestration state.
- **Never publish a file with a bare `fs.rename`.** Use `renameAtomic` or `writeFileAtomic` from
  `src/core/fs-atomic.ts`. On Windows a rename fails with `EPERM` whenever anything has the
  destination open — Defender scanning the file you just wrote, the search indexer, OneDrive — so
  the plain version loses saves intermittently and only on other people's machines. A test scans
  for this and will fail your PR; `docs/atomic-writes.md` explains why the retry is safe. Every
  temp/part staging name must also be unique per call across processes and cleaned by its owner —
  including paths embedded in generated SSH commands or handed to scp, which the `fs` scan cannot
  see. Keep a remote temp's own leaf bounded: extending an already-valid maximum-length target leaf
  with a UUID suffix turns an atomic write into a guaranteed `ENAMETOOLONG` failure.

- **Never write a remote file with `cat > <file>`.** It truncates the file the moment the remote
  shell starts, and when the ssh channel dies before the body arrives `cat` exits 0 — a reconnect
  once left a host's canvas shims at 0 bytes with every agent call "succeeding" silently. Use
  `runRemoteAtomicWrite` / `remoteAtomicWrite` (`src/main/remote-atomic-write.ts`), which checks the
  byte count before renaming and throws when the write did not land, and for a file that belongs
  to the user (settings, config.toml, AGENTS.md) use `updateRemoteTextFile`, which also keeps its
  symlink and mode. A guard test fails on a new bare `cat >`. A remote runner RESOLVES on a
  non-zero exit, so check the result or use the helper that does.

- **A new agent-facing doc on an SSH host goes into the agent-tools plan.** The canvas/context
  shims, their skills and our instruction-file blocks are listed once in `remote-hooks.ts`
  (`canvasControlArtifacts` and its siblings); the installers AND the connect-time freshness check
  (`RemoteHooks.refreshAgentTools`) read that list, so a host is brought up to your build's bytes
  on the next connect. A shim, skill or block written from anywhere else is written once and never
  checked again — hosts then keep the old text across app updates. This is ONLY for those docs:
  hook scripts and hook config stay in `setup()`'s ordered chain, and the endpoint file and node
  tokens carry credentials — never put them on a freshness cadence.

- **Never write `chmod <mode> -- <file>` into a remote command.** macOS (BSD) chmod stops parsing
  options at the mode, so the `--` becomes a file operand and the command fails there while passing
  on Linux. To test it on Linux, put a `POSIXLY_CORRECT=1` wrapper around GNU chmod first on PATH.

- **A write ack is a claim about a WRITE, never about what the remote now holds.** Do not retire
  state that records "the server still needs to be told X" just because the write returned true.
  The SSH mirror's writer acks the 5 s throttle's trailing write **optimistically** — it returns
  true and schedules the run — so a connection that dies inside that window leaves an ack behind
  with nothing on the wire. Deleting the deletion tombstones on that ack is how 16 terminals
  deleted on a slow link came back, announced as sessions from a phone the reporter does not own
  (`clearedNodes` / `confirmClearedDeletions`, `src/core/workspace-store.ts`). Retire such state on
  a READ that shows the remote no longer has it — which is the same rule this codebase already
  applies in the other direction, "a failed read is never evidence of absence". And when you cannot
  observe where incoming data came from, **do not name a source in the UI copy**: a wrong
  attribution sends the reader hunting for a device instead of at the file.

- **Never write to a child's stdin without an `'error'` listener on that stream.** A pipe write's
  failure is not a throw at the call site: when the child exits before draining stdin (a CLI handed
  a flag it doesn't know, an unreachable ssh host), Node re-emits the EPIPE as an async `'error'`
  EVENT on the stream — a try/catch around the write is inert, and the unhandled event crashes the
  whole main process with an "Uncaught Exception: write EPIPE" dialog (issue #382's class). Attach
  `child.stdin.on('error', ...)` before the first write — log via `console.warn` so the debug ring
  sees it, or settle the pending call; the child's exit code stays the authority on the outcome
  (see `tmux-control-client.ts` and `pty-manager.ts` `runWithStdin` for the house pattern). A test
  (`src/core/stream-epipe.guard.test.ts`) scans for this and will fail your PR.

- **Never unmount, move or re-key a browser/web node's element.** An Electron `<webview>`'s guest
  process dies on DOM detach — and a detach includes any `insertBefore`/`appendChild` MOVE of an
  attached element, which React performs whenever a kept child's relative order among kept keyed
  children changes. That is why webview-hosting nodes render in one stable pool region at the tail
  of the `<ReactFlow>` nodes prop (`renderer/lib/webviewKeepAlive.ts` — read its header before
  touching the merge, the node array swap in Canvas's load effect, or anything that reorders
  nodes), and why a background project's pages stay mounted as hidden ghosts instead of
  unmounting. `display:none` is safe (measured: state, scroll and viewport size survive); a reorder
  or unmount reloads the user's page and loses their in-page state.

- **Never rely on React Flow's `fitView` resolving, and never wait on `nodesInitialized`.**
  `fitView` is deferred behind that flag, and this canvas holds it at `false` permanently: the
  webview keep-alive ghosts are `display:none` with no size and cannot be `hidden` (that unmounts
  the guest), so React Flow never measures them. A queued `fitView` then does nothing on the click
  and may resolve after a project switch against a node list its target has left — an empty fit
  set, bounds `{0,0,0,0}`, the camera parked on the world origin at max zoom, and `onMove` persists
  it. There is one global queue slot and nothing cancels it, so a stale fit also overrides a camera
  move that already landed — which is why NO path in `Canvas.tsx` calls it any more, fit-all
  included, and a whole-file test pin says so. Compute the rect yourself and call `setViewport`
  (`renderer/lib/nodeFocus.ts` + `Canvas.frameNode`); if the size is unknowable, stand still. When
  you reproduce an existing fit, mind that xyflow's **numeric** padding is a ratio applied on top of
  the bounds while **directional px** insets reserve pane edges — swapping one for the other
  silently changes the framing (measured: 12% smaller). And finite-check the rect AND the resulting
  viewport: `setViewport({x: NaN, …})` is accepted, blanks the canvas, and `onMove` persists it.

- **A `<webview>` page's wheel never reaches the host DOM.** The guest is an out-of-process frame:
  measured on Electron 42, physical Ctrl/Cmd+wheel reached the page and emitted `zoom-changed` on
  the guest `WebContents`, while no host `wheel` listener fired. Keep `nowheel` on the webview host
  (it protects React Flow routing) and install page zoom in main through `installWebviewZoom`;
  removing the class or adding a renderer wheel handler cannot implement guest zoom. The shared
  renderer controls call the same `@shared/webview-zoom` policy directly on the attached guest.

- **Rendered markdown goes inside a listed container.** A link in `renderMarkdown` output keeps its
  href as written, and a relative one used to navigate the whole app window away (the canvas was
  gone until a reload). One delegated handler (`renderer/lib/markdownLinks.ts`) intercepts clicks
  inside `RENDERED_MARKDOWN_CONTAINERS`; a new surface that injects markdown HTML must use one of
  those classes or join the list — `markdownLinks.test.ts` fails otherwise.
- **A loading indicator is `components/Spinner`, never a local spinner.** `.nt-spinner` is the one
  ring in `styles.css`, and it freezes under `prefers-reduced-motion`; a local copy is how a
  spinner kept rotating for users who asked for no motion, and how two rings swapped mid-load. Put
  `role="status"` on the row holding the text, not on a second spinner beside it.

These are the ones that come up in review most often. Each exists because its absence caused a real
bug.

**A project-scoped lookup cannot prove a node does not exist elsewhere.** Link refusals must
name the project boundary and explain that cross-project linking is unsupported; do not scan other
projects just to improve a missing-endpoint diagnostic.

**A failed read is never evidence of absence.** "Could not measure" and "there is nothing" are
different facts and must stay distinguishable at every layer. Collapsing them is how a panel ends up
reporting "no sessions" on a host running thirty. When something ACTS on the negative, give it three
answers rather than two — `present | absent | unknown` (`TranscriptPresence` is the shape) — and let
only the positive finding trigger the action. Ask which of the two mistakes is recoverable: cold
restore wrongly resuming a dead session id costs an error line, while wrongly dropping a live one
opens a blank conversation over work the user believed was continuing.

**Degrade to nothing, never to something wrong.** A probe that fails means the bare, safe command —
never a substituted nearest match. A hand-editable value that is unrecognised must yield the safe
default, never something more destructive than the default.

**A node's OWNERSHIP is persisted state, never a live object.** "Is this node remote / whose host is
it on?" must be answerable with nothing attached, because the questions that ask it — a delete, a
kill, a cleanup — arrive precisely when nothing is: after an app restart, after the offscreen
release, after the park timer, for a project that is not open. `PtyManager.runEndSession` read it
off the dying in-memory `Session` instead, so an SSH node deleted with no live client had its remote
`kill-session` skipped **in silence** and its one kill sent to the LOCAL tmux socket, where a
`requireRemote` node has nothing; the node left the canvas looking deleted and its `nt-<id>` kept
running on the host. Ask the machine-local index (`workspaceStore.sshProjectIdForNode`), and treat a
live handle as the *complement* of that answer, not its source.

**A side effect you could not deliver is not a side effect you performed.** The `ok:false` rule is
not only for reads. `catch {}` around a remote kill folded "tmux says there is no such session" (an
ANSWER) into "the ControlMaster is down" (a NON-answer, session still running). Classify the failure
— and when the work genuinely cannot be done now, either refuse the action with a reason or write
the debt down and settle it later (`core/pending-remote-kills.ts`). Silently dropping it is the one
option that is never available.

**A Server Edition agent owns only nodes it freshly opened in this server run.** The
creator ledger is process-local and must never be rebuilt from `.nodeterm/project.json`, titles,
hook history, or a surviving tmux name: all are writable or stale. A restart therefore clears
ownership, performs no node/session adoption, and leaves durable queued launches dormant. Metadata
mutations and message delivery validate every target before writing anything; missing proof is a
named refusal. Validate Server upgrades against a disposable data directory and port. Restarting a
shared live service is
an explicit operator action, never a test or an automatic repair step.

**A plain terminal is not a Claude node.** It may carry the generic node/endpoint wiring needed for
a hand-launched agent to report hooks, but it gets no `NODETERM_AGENT_ID` and no
`NODETERM_CANVAS_CONTROL` until the serialized node explicitly names an agent.

**Re-validate hand-editable values at the point of use**, not by their TypeScript type. Settings
come from git-shared JSON and can end up interpolated into a shell command line. The same goes for
node ids: a string built from them (a subscription signature, a claim or cache key) writes them with
`JSON.stringify`, never joined with a separator — an id containing `|` or `:` otherwise forges an
entry for another node.

**Test generated shell for real.** If you generate a shell command, run it under an actual
`/bin/sh` against a fixture tree. A composed fixture will not tell you that `echo ##MEM` prints an
empty line because `#` starts a comment.

**Share with team's remote commands are generated shell, and so is their test.** The probe, the
installer wrapper, the `team` invocations and the kill-verify are built in
`src/core/remote-ssh/share-team-remote.ts` and run under a real `/bin/sh` against a fake host in its
test; a change to one of them lands with a run there. The handover kill stays on the `nodeterm-rmt`
socket only, with exact `=nt-<id>` targets: the every-socket kill used elsewhere would also stop the
server core's `node-terminal` sessions, which are the ones the handover is starting. See CLAUDE.md
"Share with team".

**Remote context polling must bound bytes before SSH transports them.** Bootstrap from the
file's measured end, keep offsets in raw bytes, and distinguish an idle read from failure so
the poller can back off. A transcript that does not exist yet is idle, not a failure: Claude only
creates it on the first prompt, long after SessionStart handed over its path. Bootstrap history
restores usage only, never task/result events.
`core/remote-ssh/transcript-window.ts` and the real-shell remote-context tests pin this contract.

**A shared agent daemon is live-session infrastructure.** Codex's app-server control socket is
shared by every `--remote` TUI in an account scope, so stopping or replacing one daemon disconnects
every attached canvas node. A managed launcher must keep the already-bound thread under a bounded
supervisor: resume only when protocol health failed or the known socket generation changed, never
loop an unrelated client error, and never replay the original prompt after reconnect. Probe a
responsive daemon before invoking lifecycle repair; stale PID bookkeeping is not permission to kill
working sessions. See `docs/shared-codex-node-identity.md`.

**Never make the Codex daemon a precondition.** `codex app-server daemon start` runs only on the
installer-managed standalone Codex (`$CODEX_HOME/packages/standalone/current/codex`); on a Homebrew
or npm install it exits. Anything that needs a fact the daemon can answer must also be able to read
it from the account home: identity from `auth.json`'s `id_token`, a thread's rollout from
`sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-*-<id>.jsonl`. A daemon-only reader kept every managed Codex account
`pending` forever on those installs, and pending accounts appear nowhere else in the UI.

**Claude and Codex account ids share an alphabet.** The same id can name a Claude account and a
Codex account at once. Never key a Codex decision on a Claude field or the other way round: Codex
has its own project default (`defaultCodexAccountId`), its own row actions and its own
bulk-move filter.

**A plain Codex TUI must not join Codex's own auto-started daemon.** From codex-cli 0.157.0 a
plain `codex` starts (or joins) ONE background app-server per `CODEX_HOME` that keeps the
environment of the pane that STARTED it, so every later node's hooks and tool shells run with the
first node's `NODETERM_NODE_ID` (measured on 0.159.2). Every nodeterm codex line therefore ends in
`--no-daemon` when the CLI that will run it advertised the flag — added in the two assemblers
(`shared/agents/launch.ts` via `withCodexNoDaemon`), fed by `ApprovalCaps.codexNoDaemon`. A new
codex launch site goes through those assemblers and threads the caps; never type a bare `codex` line
yourself, and AWAIT `ensureCodexLaunchCaps` (bounded) where the site is async — a synchronous
read loses the race when every node cold-restores after a reboot. A relay tab or SSH node must be
passed as remote: the guest's or laptop's answer never applies to another machine's codex. The
flag must never meet `--remote` (codex refuses the pair), which is why the managed launcher strips
it. See CLAUDE.md "Codex's auto-started shared daemon".

**Credentials never ride argv — local or SSH.** Not a tmux `-e` pair, not `curl -H`, not a remote
command string. `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` is mode 444 on a stock Linux, and a remote command line is argv
on the host too: we shipped the hook bearer that way and any other account on the machine could read
it and open a terminal running an arbitrary command. Pass secrets by 0600 file or by **stdin**
(`curl --config -`), and never add an argv fallback. See `docs/node-identity.md`. That includes the
examples we SHOW users to copy (the push webhook's curl pipes its header on stdin, and a test runs
it under `/bin/sh` to prove it): a user pastes what we print into a CI job on a shared runner.

**A hook socket path is not ownership proof.** Never unlink a live listener to bind a hook
socket, or overwrite an advertisement whose socket/TCP listener still answers. Local stale cleanup requires `ECONNREFUSED` and an unchanged socket inode; regular files,
symlinks and uncertain probes are preserved. SSH setup allocates a fresh socket and publishes an
installation-qualified endpoint only after bearer verification. A wrong bearer answers 421 before
any handler runs; only that explicit wrong-owner response (or transport failure) permits endpoint
failover. A node-identity 403 stays final. Test with disposable sockets, never a running user's tunnel.

**Both raw listeners change together** — `src/main/index.ts` and `src/server/agent-status.ts`. A new
field on a hook event that reaches only the desktop leaves the Server Edition quietly without the
feature, and the boundary tests can only tell you an import is wrong, never that a field is missing.
The same applies to any hook-server signature change; this repo has shipped one to a single shell
three times.

**A rule enforced at one mint site is enforced nowhere.** Nodes are created on two surfaces — the
canvas (`createAgentNode`) and the phone's `projects.registerNode` (`appendProjectNode`) — and a
constraint spelled out inline at one of them silently does not exist at the other. "Which agents
bind a managed account" lived as a ternary in the renderer while the phone leg wrote whatever the
wire sent.
Put the rule in one predicate under `src/shared` and have every mint site ask it, and derive the
things that follow from it (a node's color, say) from that same call rather than re-deriving the
condition per caller.

**A feature that creates links owes an ownership rule, and it must be a property of the plan.**
"Share `~/.claude/skills` with this account" (issue #643) links each system skill into a managed
account's own `skills/` and removes those links again when switched off — one wrong removal deletes
somebody's real skills folder. Three habits made it safe and they generalize: link the LEAVES, not
the containing directory (nodeterm writes its own canvas skill into `<configDir>/skills/`, so a
directory-level link would have written it into the user's system folder); decide ownership by an
anchored SHAPE (a symlink at `<name>` pointing at `<system>/<name>`) so what the on-switch creates
is exactly what the off-switch removes, and a real directory can never qualify; and compare
REALPATHS before acting, because the hand-made version of the same feature makes the two directories
one and linking into it would plant links in the folder you are about to clean up. Verify the
removal against a real filesystem with real symlinks and real content — a mocked `fs` agrees with
whatever the code believed. And a launch-time sweep may re-create, never delete: ownership inferred
from shape cannot tell your link from an identical one the user made by hand.

**Do not take scrolling away from tmux.** It owns the mouse, the scrollback and the alternate
screen. A previous design moved that into the emulator and failed structurally; `.claude/rules/terminal.md`
explains why in detail.

**A spawn-env write does not reach a tmux session on its own.** The shared tmux server takes each
new session's env from its own GLOBAL env (inherited from whichever client *started* the server) —
the creating client's process env only matters for names listed in `update-environment` (or passed
as non-secret `-e` pairs). Setting `env.FOO` in `pty-manager` therefore works for the plain-shell
fallback and for the one client that happens to start the server, and silently does nothing (or
worse, leaks the server-starter's value into everyone else) after that. That is how issue #419
shipped: managed-account `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` leaked into system-account sessions. New per-session
env either joins `ACCOUNT_SCOPE_UPDATE_ENV` / the gateway list, or rides `-e` — and gets a
real-tmux test (`account-env.realtmux.test.ts` is the pattern).

**A new keyboard chord has to survive the shells, not just the renderer.** The application menu is
ours (`buildAppMenu` in `main/index.ts`), but its command-style accelerators — ⌘Q, ⌘M, ⌘W, ⌘0, ⌘⇧B,
⌘, — are still handled above the page, so your `keydown` branch simply never runs: steal the chord
back in `main/keydown-intercept.ts`'s `before-input-event` allowlist and forward it, like the three
already there. Two legs stand the menu down instead of stealing — the terminal-first policy and an
armed shortcut recorder (`menuStandsDown` → `menuItemIdsToSuspend`, since a disabled item suppresses
its accelerator) — and Reload (⌘R / ⌘⇧R) is the named exception that always stays with the app,
because it is the crash-recovery lever. Browsers own a different set. And any chord that reaches the canvas needs the two refusals every canvas shortcut
here has: not while the kanban board covers it, not while the user is typing.

**A new chord needs no edit to the shortcuts panel — and must not get one.** `ShortcutsPanel`
derives its whole inventory from `COMMAND_DEFINITIONS` (section per `CommandGroup`, label from
`def.title`, chord from the EFFECTIVE binding), so adding a registry command is all it takes to
make it show up; a command with no effective binding is omitted rather than listed chord-less.
`ShortcutsPanel.test.tsx` is the watchdog and reds if a command fails to surface. The panel it
replaced hand-listed 24 ids against a 45-command registry and had drifted four live chords behind
— if you find yourself typing a command id into that file, that is the bug reappearing.

**Comments explain WHY, and name the failure they prevent.** The codebase is deliberately dense with
reasoning. A comment that restates the code is noise; one that says "do not simplify this back,
here is what broke" is the point.

**A generated sh client reads its node token through the one resolver.** Every POSIX-sh client we
emit (the managed hook script, `nodeterm.sh`, `context.sh`) presents this node's per-node identity by
calling `nt_read_node_token` from `core/agents/node-token-sh.ts` — never by re-typing
`head -n 1 "$NODETERM_NODE_TOKEN_DIR/$NODETERM_NODE_ID"`. That copy was issue #384: a session is
pinned for life to the endpoint FILE path it got at tmux creation, so a client that trusts only what
that file advertises presents nothing forever when the file is old or unreadable — and because the
hook script alone could heal itself, the same node proved itself through one client and was refused
through another for the life of the session.

**Local generated sh clients recover shared-Codex identity before their env gate.** A Codex tool
shell is forked by the account-scoped app-server, so it has `CODEX_THREAD_ID` but not the pane's
`NODETERM_*`. Managed hooks, local `nodeterm.sh`, and local `context.sh` must prepend
`codexThreadIdentityResolverSh(codexThreadIdentityRoot())` before checking `NODETERM_NODE_ID` or
`NODETERM_CANVAS_CONTROL`. Keep the SSH shim constants machine-neutral: baking the desktop/server
record path into a remote host is both wrong and a local-layout leak. A guard test enforces that
(`remote-shim-neutrality.guard.test.ts`), because the leak is silent — the remote shim keeps
working, and nothing goes red.

**That prelude may not decide anything a pane already decided.** It exports the agent id and the
canvas-control grant the ownership RECORD carries, never constants. They used to be hardcoded
(`codex`, granted) and both are `buildPtyEnv`'s answers: a custom agent inheriting the codex harness
is `custom:<uuid>`, and the grant comes from `canControlCanvas`. If you add a field the prelude
exports, put it inside the record's HMAC and have the desktop re-derive anything that grants a
capability — never accept the client's word for that. Withhold rather than assume: a tool shell
missing a verb its pane has is a bug report, a tool shell holding one its pane was denied is a
security question.

**A shell that forwards data into these records cannot be type-checked into correctness.** A
handler that destructures the request without the new field, and a call that omits an optional
trailing argument, are both well-typed — so the feature ships inert with a green suite. Pin the
wiring at source level (`codex-identity-record-wiring.test.ts`, `hook-verified-parity.test.ts`).

**A stream error is not a throw you can catch.** When a write to `process.stdout`/`stderr` fails —
`EPIPE` down a closed pipe, `EIO` after macOS revokes a closed terminal's tty — node reports it by
emitting `'error'` on the stream a tick later, and the default for an unhandled `'error'` event is
to kill the process. The stack it carries was captured at the write, so the crash *reads* as if it
happened synchronously at your `console.log`, and wrapping that call in `try/catch` changes nothing
(measured on node 22). If you write to a stream that can go away, attach an `'error'` listener and
latch the writer off — `installLogSink` (`src/core/log-sink.ts`) is the worked example. Issue #382.

**A retry budget must measure the thing it is waiting for, and running out must be VISIBLE.** The
armed-launch loop (canvas-control `--after`, and the cold open a `--project` node gets) delivered its
held command on a flat 5 × 400 ms budget started when the *canvas* held the node — so on a cold
project switch it was spent loading the canvas, mounting the node and spawning tmux, and the launch
was abandoned before the session it was for existed. Two rules came out of issue #569: wait on a
real signal (`isSessionReady`, published by the node when its shell settles) rather than on a
stopwatch aimed at the wrong start, and never let "we gave up" live only in a `console.warn` — the
node shows it (`state/launchDelivery.ts` → the QUEUED badge's ⚠ + tooltip) and the canvas-control
reply carries it (`queued` / `queuedIds`), because a user who cannot see the failure and an
orchestrator that is told "opened" both act on a session that is not there. If you add a bounded
retry anywhere, ask what the clock actually starts on and where its exhaustion becomes visible.

**A held launch is an exec field, and a gate nobody can read stays CLOSED.** `pendingLaunch` is a
command typed into a shell when its wait ends, so it is MACHINE-LOCAL like `shell`
(`src/shared/node-exec.ts`): it rides workspace.json's `localExec`, never the git-shared
`.nodeterm/project.json`, and a peer's or relay guest's value is dropped on `canvas:mut`. A write
your renderer authors into a background project goes through `applyOwnNodeMutation`, never the
peer path `applyNodeMutation` (which strips the launch and cannot clear one). Where a value is read
(workspace.json is still hand-editable), `normalizePendingLaunch`
(`src/shared/pending-launch-shape.ts`) runs at both serializer seams: an `after` that is not a list
used to throw inside the canvas's dependency-signature selector. Its rule, and the rule for any new
gate you add (the `--after-success` wait is the latest): a value it cannot read turns the
hold `manualOnly` or never-satisfied, never "no gate" — dropping it would start the node early, and
a dependent that has launched cannot un-launch. A new gate field also goes in that module's `KNOWN`
set, and `launchesToFire` must treat a missing context for it as closed. If both shells evaluate the
gate (the Server Edition's headless factory releases its own held launches), put the evaluation in
`src/shared` beside the shape, as `@shared/station-outcome` does, so the desktop and the server
cannot disagree about when a dependent starts. And never let a gate read its "satisfied" from a
file: a success a git commit can claim releases every dependent waiting on it — the station's
report lives in a transient core store, and its board-log line is display only.

**Never move the user's view on a background agent's say-so.** Canvas-control requests route by
SOURCE, and React Flow holds only the ACTIVE project's nodes — so the dispatch used to travel to the
caller's project before answering. For an OPEN that was a screen hijack: the user is looking at
project B, an agent in project A runs `open-claude`, the tab switches and A's saved viewport is
applied, so the camera appears to jump and zoom. The rule now has three tiers, all membership lists
in `renderer/lib/controlRouting.ts`: `STORE_ANSWERED_VERBS` ("no canvas is needed at either end" —
`list`, `send`, `reply`, `sticky`, `open-project`, `settings`), `canColdOpen` ("a canvas IS needed, but the
serialized one will do" — `open-terminal`, `open-claude`, `open-agent`, which write into the owning
project's stored nodes with their launch armed and report `queued: true`) and `answersOffCanvas`
("…and there is nothing to defer" — `show-image`, `show-video`, `show-web`, `open-browser`, whose
node has no session behind it and is finished the moment it is written, so it reports `offCanvas:
true` and never `queued`). Everything that acts on nodes which already exist still travels, because
it reads live state the serialized copy does not carry — `browser` included, which navigates a
mounted `<webview>` guest, unlike `open-browser`, which only places the node.

Three things to carry over when you put a verb in one of the two off-screen tiers. **The acting
project is the SOURCE's**: `ctlProject` decides the ssh flag, the browser session key and the media
allowlist route, and reading `activeProjectId` there answers a background agent with whatever the
human is looking at. **Nothing may reach the live canvas**: `setNodes` / `setControlEdges` /
`markDirty` address the ACTIVE project, so the write goes through `applyNodeMutation` +
`appendCanvasLinks` + `writeDisk`. And **tell the human** — the reply goes to the agent, so without
a strip nothing anywhere reports that a node landed in another project; it is sticky, because it
describes work the user was not watching. When you add a verb, decide which tier it is in — and if
you change what a verb DOES, update `buildCanvasSkillBody` / `buildCanvasControlInstructions` in the
same PR, with a test that goes red on the stale claim (`src/main/canvas-control-core.test.ts`).

**Pointing a project at a folder is a WRITE — probe before you bind.** A project's canvas is
written to `<cwd>/.nodeterm/project.json`, so the moment a project gains a `cwd` the next autosave
owns that file. "Open folder…" always probed and adopted; "Set folder…" (tab ⌄) used to bind
unconditionally, which overwrote a canvas a teammate had committed to that repo — their nodes gone,
no backup, nothing on screen. Both entrances now share the rule (`renderer/lib/setProjectFolder.ts`):
an occupied *or unreadable* project file refuses the bind and says why. The store's "never
blind-write" guard will not save you — it only refuses an EMPTY canvas over a populated file.

**Every workspace entry is a REF — content in a file, machine-local state on the entry.** There are
three kinds and they now share one shape: a folder ref (`<cwd>/.nodeterm/project.json`, git-shared),
an SSH ref (the same file on the host, with an offline `cache`), and a cwd-less canvas
(`userData/inline-projects/<id>.json`, with the entry's `project` field kept as a cache for one
release so an older build still reads it). Two habits follow. **Content goes in the file; anything
this machine would legitimately disagree with another machine about — project id, viewport, default
account, breadcrumbs, closed-session history, per-node `shell` and held `pendingLaunch` — goes on the index entry**
(`IndexEntryV3`), or a `git worktree add` / a second instance hands one machine's state to another.
And **`workspace.json` is one file with last-writer-wins semantics, so it may not be the only home
of any content**: that is precisely what let a second app instance erase a cwd-less canvas. Between
two instances the arbiter is the file's `rev` — a lower rev never overwrites a higher one — and
there is no merge; if you add a fourth kind, give it a file and say which rev wins.

**A project with no folder is a real project — degrade explicitly, never silently.** "New project"
creates a cwd-less canvas, so every folder-shaped feature meets one. Keep the affordance and
disable it with its reason (`NEW_FILE_NO_CWD_HINT`,
`WORKTREE_NO_CWD_HINT`, the Explorer/Source Control notes); a row that simply vanishes teaches
nothing, and a message that names the wrong cause ("not a git repository" for a project that has no
folder to be one) sends the user hunting a problem that does not exist.

**Agent features attach to base harness capabilities, not frontend allowlists.** A custom agent can
inherit a builtin harness, so add the capability and its one shared leaf (`src/shared/agents`) and
let every UI ask the helper. Repeating Claude/Codex/etc. cases in menus breaks that inheritance and
eventually drifts.

**Never put a raw NUL byte in a source file — write `\x00`.** Git classifies a file containing one
as *binary*, so it renders as "Binary files differ" in every diff surface (the PR page, `git diff`,
`git log -p`) and `git grep` skips it. It still compiles and its tests still pass, so nothing fails
— the file just becomes invisible to review, which is the worst way for this to go wrong. A
separator or sentinel is a fine reason to want the byte; the escape is the same byte and keeps the
file text. `src/shared/source-hygiene.test.ts` enforces this across every tracked `.ts`/`.tsx`.

**Paths cross machines, so treat `\` as a separator wherever you split one.** A value persisted in
`.nodeterm/project.json` is written by one machine and validated on another, so a guard that reads
`\` as an ordinary filename character is simply wrong about the machine that will resolve it. This
has already produced a real hole: a traversal check that split on `/` alone saw `./a\..\..\x.png`
as a single harmless segment on *every* platform. Split on `[\\/]`, and prefer accepting both
dialects while storing only one (see **Node icons** in CLAUDE.md for the worked example).

**Canvas edges are all `type: 'floating'`, and one relation gets one edge.** Never set
`sourceHandle`/`targetHandle` on an edge object — the rendered path is computed from the two nodes'
rectangles (`renderer/lib/floatingEdge.ts`), and a fixed side is what sent an edge to a node placed
left of its source looping across the whole canvas. And do not add a second edge family for a
relation a rope already carries: `--after` is a **rope** whose dashed "⏳ waits for" look is DERIVED
from the target's `pendingLaunch` (`renderer/lib/edgeModel.ts`), and the context bridge it also
writes stays hidden underneath it. One `open-claude --after` used to land three edges on one node.
`src/renderer/canvas/edge-model.source.test.ts` pins both halves.

**A canvas layout is GEOMETRY, and its two halves live in different files.** A saved layout moves
nodes and nothing else: it never creates, deletes, renames, reparents or respawns one, and never
touches a tmux session. The snapshot itself (`Project.layouts`) is CONTENT and rides the git-shared
`.nodeterm/project.json`, while this machine's camera per layout (`Project.layoutViewports`) is
machine-local and rides `workspace.json` beside `viewport` and `breadcrumbs`. Restoring applies its
camera with `setViewport`, per the `fitView` rule below. Deleting a layout and updating one to the
arrangement on screen both confirm first, because layout edits are not in the undo stack; restoring
does not, because it is. Whether a dialog claims the edit reaches other people comes from
`layoutIsShared`, which is true for an SSH project as well as a folder one.

**Keep-alive webview ghosts must stay mounted, but must not enter minimap geometry.**
They use `display:none`, not React Flow's `hidden` (which unmounts the guest). Render canvas maps
through `VisibleMiniMap`: it filters both drawing and bounds in a minimap-only store while sharing
the live camera. A transparent rectangle alone still distorts the map's scale.

**React Flow's `fitView` is queued, not immediate — never use it to frame something automatically.**
Calling it sets `fitViewQueued` and the fit runs from a later `setNodes` (only once every node is
measured) or the next `updateNodeInternals`, against whatever the node lookup holds by then; a fit
set that comes out empty parks the canvas origin in the middle of the screen. Compute the viewport
yourself and apply it with `setViewport` (`renderer/lib/nodeFocus.ts`, `canvas/fit-view.ts`), which
lands now and against the canvas you meant. `fitAll` is the one deliberate exception: an explicit
user gesture on a settled canvas.

**A context menu is two levels deep, and the third level is discarded in silence.**
`ContextMenu` renders a submenu's children with
`if (child.type === 'colors' || child.type === 'submenu') return null` — no error, no warning,
nothing on screen. That matters most where you cannot see it: Claude's and Codex's **account
pickers are themselves submenus**, so moving one of those rows into another submenu deletes the
account picker for exactly the users who have managed accounts, and looks perfect to everyone
else. If you group rows in an add menu, get the decision from `isPinnedAgentEntry`
(`renderer/lib/addMenuSpec`) rather than judging by eye — and never spell an agent id there: which
rows stay at the top is derived from the row's own shape plus `ACCOUNT_CAPABLE_AGENT_IDS`, so a new
agent is handled the day it is added. The cap is measured in
`components/ContextMenu.submenu-depth.test.tsx`; if you teach the component a third level, that
test tells you which pin to revisit.

**Adding a node kind means touching the add menus once, not four times.**
`renderer/lib/addMenuSpec` owns which kinds are addable and how they are grouped, for the canvas
pane right-click, the sessions-sidebar "+" and the Dock. `ADD_ITEM_GROUP` is a total `Record` over
the kind union, so a new kind is a **compile error** until you route it. The kanban column's
"+ New session" is deliberately not a consumer — it can only offer kinds that become a card — and
`addMenuSpec.surfaces.test.ts` pins that split so "make them all consistent" stays a decision
rather than a reflex.

**A setting read at mount reads the DEFAULT, not the user's.** `useSettings` starts on
`DEFAULT_SETTINGS` and hydrates from disk asynchronously, while `<Canvas />` is mounted before that
lands. A `useState(() => settings.foo ? ...)` initializer therefore reads the shipped default and
never looks again, so an opt-in feature ships inert with a green suite and no error anywhere. Gate
on `hydrated` (the first-launch consent dialog and `settings.rememberCanvasLock` are the worked
examples). If the same effect also WRITES, latch its first run: otherwise switching the setting on
mid-session applies stored state to whatever the user is doing right then, which is a different
feature from the one they asked for.

**Canvas's `nodesRef` / `nodesProjectIdRef` are the LATEST pair, not the rendered one.** During a
project switch a zustand write re-renders Canvas at SyncLane before the load's DefaultLane
`setNodes` lands, so for a moment the ref names the incoming project while the render's `nodes`
are still the outgoing one's (`canvas/nodesEpoch.ts`). Event-time code (commits, the `canvas:mut`
receive path, creates) reads the refs; code that pairs the tag with the RENDERED `nodes` (a
render-time publish, an effect keyed on `nodes`) reads `renderedProjectId`. A peer op goes live
only when `liveCanvasHolds` says React Flow has that project, and its `setNodes` is functional
(`rebaseOnLatest`). `nodesEpoch.test.tsx` reproduces the window with real React; never wrap it in
`act`, which flushes both lanes together and hides it.

Maximize placement and refocusing must use the same measured usable rectangle
(`measureMaximizeInsets`): pinned side panels plus persistent top controls and bottom dock.
Do not hardcode chrome heights or add the outer margin twice; transient menus must not resize
terminals. Ordinary focus and zone snap keep their own policies. Test the maximized-only
focus decision through `viewportForNodeFocus`, the same helper Canvas calls, rather than
passing preselected insets straight to the geometry function.

**Usage readouts distinguish failed reads from empty data.** For Claude, show the failure when
`status` is `error` and limits are empty, including beside other providers; preserve last-known
bars when limits remain. Keep both single-account and multi-account views covered.

**A context capacity needs session provenance.** Claude's effective `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS`
is reported by its managed hook, accepted only with verified node identity, and validated as a
positive decimal safe integer. Never read the app's global env for another session or let a
model-family guess enlarge an observed limit. Unobserved Claude windows are labelled estimates.
The renderer rehydrates through `context.ensure`; it does not restore Claude denominators from
storage. Other agents retain transcript-window persistence.
Only an explicit ensure replays an unchanged live snapshot; repeated hook observations must not
broadcast it again. Remote path, ControlMaster or connection changes replace the tracked generation.

**Command-bearing terminal opens (issue #653):** the shared hook-server route requires verified
node identity whenever `open-terminal` carries `cmd`, including an empty value or a dry run.
The strict-policy override and foreign-instance fallback cannot release this gate. Desktop plain
terminal opens keep their existing identity policy; Server Edition still requires verification
for every control verb. Legacy mobile/SSH callers must present this instance’s node token for
command-bearing opens; this does not add a human-confirm dialog or change mobile transport APIs.

Grok billing diagnostics must keep HTTP codes and safe failure categories per billing view. Never send raw error messages, URLs or response bodies to the UI; credentials remain read-only. A failed view is not proof that there is no quota, even when the other view responds.

**Phone chat verbs (`chat.page` / `chat.status` / `chat.send` / `agent.answer`).** Full contract in
`docs/mobile-chat-view.md` §3. Three rules get a PR sent back:
- **The phone sends only a `nodeId`.** Cwd, account, agent, session id and remote routing come from
  this machine's records. Never add a param that lets the phone name a path, a session or a host.
- **The `chat` dependency is optional at every hop** (host-service handler, `HostSessionOptions`,
  `HostBridgeDeps`), so dropping it anywhere still compiles and ships the verbs as "not served".
  `host-chat-wiring.test.ts` pins the chain; extend it when you add a hop.
- **`'unconfirmed'` is never a refusal.** It means the desktop could not confirm whether the text
  was typed. Nothing may treat it as "safe to resend": the phone keeps the draft, re-reads, and lets
  the user decide. Only `'refused'` means nothing was typed.

## User-owned agent settings

Claude/Gemini settings must go through the guarded transactions in
`src/core/agents/hooks/{settings-file,remote-settings-file}.ts`. Confirmed absence or a successfully read empty/whitespace file may start from `{}`;
malformed, non-object and unreadable files must survive unchanged.
Keep unrelated settings and foreign hook handlers. Stage writes, serialize nodeterm writers,
and compare the original bytes again before publishing; never use `cat … || echo '{}'` or a
catch-all read fallback. Local and SSH symlinked profiles update and lock the resolved target without replacing
the link; recheck resolution before publishing. SSH uses plain readlink and cd -P (no GNU -f),
and refuses dangling/cyclic links and newline paths. A conflicting/stale lock skips installation
with a diagnostic naming the lock and safe manual recovery; do not steal it from another process. These locks
coordinate nodeterm, not external editors, so do not claim a filesystem-wide compare-and-swap.
**Creating an agent node is not proof it started.** Control opens retain their launch command
until delivery is acknowledged, and report `queued` while it is held. A successful terminal send
proves delivery only; never describe it as a healthy/running agent without agent evidence.
Every launch uses the echo-verified command writer (`@shared/command-delivery`), not `sendText`:
desktop automatic and Run now, the desktop's headless start, and the Server Edition's immediate
open and `run` (the last three through `core/headless-launch.ts`). The Server Edition's deferred
`--after` release (`refreshArmed`) is the one remaining `sendText` launch, pending a move that must
never create a session.
Keep unsubmitted UI intent durable through shell settle/unmount. New intent carries `attempted:false`;
Desktop and Server save `attempted:true` before input. Never-attempted warm `--after` launches may
proceed after shell verification; attempted/legacy-unknown intent requires Run now. Only confirmed
submission clears intent. Desktop open replies use `createControlOpenBatch` for queued accounting;
protect that contract and concurrent submission with behavior tests, never source-text pins.
Relay queued/restored launches and Run now are refused until a scoped durable claim API exists.
A new relay UI initialCommand may run once on a fresh PTY through the verified writer, without
workspace writes or pendingLaunch creation. Consume its transient attempt before shell settle;
never retry it on remount or serialize it as durable intent.
Never round-trip a relay workspace load into save: the load can contain only one shared project,
while save replaces the entire host index. A pre-input parked-project deferral keeps intent
never-attempted; it must not poison the writer or trigger a retry timer.
Held Desktop launches retain their attached transport even offscreen with tmux (large fan-outs cost
memory). Server deferred delivery is one-shot: a failed probe/send needs explicit recovery.
A headless start (`--run-now` / `run`, #925) follows the same contract: the claim is saved before
any spawn, and "started" means the echo-verified writer submitted the line (never that the agent is
healthy). The desktop releases its headless client, so there a start without a persistent terminal
backend fails `not-persistent` and hands the node back unchanged (a cold open stays an ordinary
queued node) rather than leaving a shell that the next mount would orphan. Normally that refusal
comes before any spawn; if the backend vanishes between the probe and the spawn, the plain shell it
got is refused before anything is typed, and releasing it kills it. A remote (SSH) node, and any
node of an SSH project, is refused in the renderer before the claim (`remote-unsupported`), which is
the primary fence. As a belt
behind it, an SSH-project node's request carries `requireRemote`, which `desktopHeadlessRequest`
keeps, so core's `spawnNew` refuses rather than spawning it locally. Keep both fences.

## Performance

Measure before you optimize, and put the before/after in the commit. The CLAUDE.md section
**Performance: measure it, then fix what the measurement names** has the method (CDP against
`npx electron-vite dev --remoteDebuggingPort 9333`) and the rules it produced. The ones that
bite most often:
- An infinite CSS animation keeps the whole window repainting at display rate. Bound it.
- Never put `will-change` on the React Flow viewport.
- `handleNodesChange` must not call `onNodesChange` with an empty batch (it re-renders the canvas
  every frame through React Flow's ResizeObserver).
- Work done per terminal on a project switch must be coalesced and on-screen-first.

**SSH projects on Windows** run over an in-process transport (`src/core/remote-ssh/native/`),
not the ssh binary. If you add an ssh call site, route it through `useNativeSsh()` like the
others, and if you add an ssh option to `control-master.ts`, teach `ssh-argv.ts` about it (the
parser refuses unknown options on purpose). Test from macOS/Linux with `NODETERM_NATIVE_SSH=1`.

**A dependency with a native addon that the Server Edition reaches is external in
`server:build`** — in this fork that is the `external` list in `scripts/build-server.mjs`, which
`server:build` runs (an inline esbuild command could not carry the `TERMSCAPE_UNGATE` define
safely). Hosts build the bundle after `npm ci --ignore-scripts`, so no addon is compiled
there, and esbuild fails on a `.node` require it cannot resolve (or, where the addon IS compiled,
on a file it has no loader for). No CI job builds the server bundle, but
`src/server/server-build.test.ts` builds it in both views (taking entry, externals and tsconfig
from the script's exported `serverBuildOptions`) and goes red. The server runs from a
`node_modules` tree, so an external is resolved at runtime.

## Testing

**Screenshot paste has one route per gesture.** On macOS, Cmd+V saves/uploads a file and
pastes its path; Ctrl+V belongs to the foreground program. A node's configured agent is not
proof of foreground clipboard-image support. Keep shell/SSH/Server file routing and capture
suppression of accompanying text; do not synthesize Ctrl+V or try both routes without a
capability and receipt protocol. The shortcuts panel documents this distinction (#712).

The titlebar's scroll viewport owns its `no-drag` region. Do not add `app-region: no-drag`
to tabs or their descendants: Electron can subtract their off-screen rectangles from the
wordmark's drag area. `scripts/tabbar-drag.test.ts` checks native hit testing with isolated
Electron/Xvfb on Linux; macOS traffic lights and actual window movement still need device checks.

`npm test` must pass, and `npm run typecheck` is the fastest gate.

**The typecheck does not catch a closure reading a later `const`.** If a helper defined in a
component body reads a `const` declared further down and the helper is CALLED during render, it
throws a TDZ `ReferenceError` at runtime while `tsc` stays green (#1090 blanked all of Settings
this way). Declare what a render-time helper closes over above the helper, and give a new
Settings section a render test with its real-world state populated — every section renders on
each Settings open, visible or not, and each is wrapped in `SettingsSectionBoundary`.

Beyond that, one habit is worth more than any other here:

**Mutation-test your guards.** Delete or invert the check you just added and confirm a test *fails*.
A green suite is not evidence on its own — during one recent feature this caught nine tests that
passed with the code they were meant to pin removed, including one mutation that survived the entire
4,500-test suite because the class it touched had no test file at all.

Watch for fixtures that cannot discriminate: if every row in your fixture happens to make the
mutant's output identical to the real one, the test proves nothing while looking thorough.

**Agents that load a JS plugin instead of running a hook command** (opencode, Pi) post through
ONE client, `src/core/agents/hooks/plugin-hook-client.ts`; do not inline a second copy. Pi only
auto-discovers `*.js` / `*.ts` in its extensions dir, so an `.mjs` there is silently never loaded
(`-e` accepts `.mjs`, which hides it). `hooks/pi.e2e.test.ts` runs the real `pi` binary when it is on
your PATH and skips otherwise; it drives a pty with `script`, which needs a real pipe on stdin, not
node's `stdio: 'pipe'` (a socketpair on macOS).

**Run the suite BEFORE you package, never after.** `npm run dist` (electron-builder) rebuilds
`node-pty` for the packaged app, and afterwards every test that spawns a real pty fails with
`Failed to spawn terminal (posix_spawn…)` — `sessionRename.realtty`, `pty-spawn-diagnosis` and
`server-e2e` are the ones that go red. It reads exactly like a regression you just caused, and the
node-pty marker test stays green (it checks the patched source, not the built binary). `npm run
rebuild` restores it. Don't spend an hour bisecting your own diff first.

**Never pin behaviour by reading source text.** `expect(SRC).toContain('...')` is the fixture that
can never discriminate: it is satisfied by code that is present *and wrong*. We shipped one —
`src/main/menu-accelerator-intercepts.test.ts` matched three strings inside the `before-input-event`
handler, and stayed green on a tree where a shared guard had moved out from under them and the bare
`0` key was swallowed app-wide. It was, precisely, red on the fix and green on the break. If a
module is untestable because it imports `electron` at the top, that is the thing to fix: lift the
decision into a pure function next to it (`keydown-intercept.ts`, `main-window.ts`,
`zoomShortcut.ts`) and press the keys.

Where a behaviour can only be verified on hardware we do not have in CI (a Mac, a real SSH host, a
GPU), say so explicitly rather than implying coverage. Several docs carry numbered device
checklists for exactly this.

**A test that reads a checked-in file must not care how git checked it out.** `.gitattributes`
declares `* text=auto eol=lf`, so every working tree is LF — but attributes only take effect on a
re-checkout, so if you cloned before it landed, run `git add --renormalize .` (or re-clone) and your
tree catches up. Windows is where this bites: Git for Windows defaults to `core.autocrlf=true`, so
without the attributes file a fresh clone had CRLF working files and `CSS.indexOf('}\n}')` matched
nothing — two suites failed on a checkout with zero local changes, and one of them reported 25 theme
tokens missing that were all present. Normalize at the read
(`readFileSync(f, 'utf8').replace(/\r\n/g, '\n')`); `src/shared/line-endings.guard.test.ts` fails on
a read that slices a `\n`-bearing literal without it.

**A test never touches a live tmux server.** You will most likely run `npm test` from inside a
nodeterm terminal, where `-L node-terminal` and `-L nodeterm-rmt` are the servers holding every
node you have open — one stray `kill-server` there ends your whole canvas, not your test. Every run
therefore gets a private `TMUX_TMPDIR` (`test/setup/tmux-sandbox.ts`), which re-points every socket
name at once. Write real-tmux suites the normal way — pick your own socket name, and use
`makeTmuxTmpdir` if you also want your own directory — and do not build an `env` object for a real
tmux without carrying `TMUX_TMPDIR` into it, which is the one way left to escape the sandbox.
`src/core/tmux-socket-isolation.guard.test.ts` holds the short allowlist of suites that name a
production socket on purpose; adding a third is a review conversation, not a checkbox.

**Session code has two local backends on POSIX: tmux and Zellij.** `settings.sessionBackend` picks
where a NEW local terminal's session is created (default tmux); an existing session is always
reattached in the backend that holds it. If you add a `PtyManager` method that talks to tmux about a
node, ask `isZellij(persistKey, live)` first and either implement the Zellij leg in
`src/core/zellij-backend.ts` or answer the explicit "unknown/refused" value and add the gap to
`ZELLIJ_BACKEND_GAPS` (the Settings row prints that list; `docs/session-backends.md` must state it).
Asking the tmux socket about a Zellij node is a guess, and `has-session` exit 1 there reads as
"cold". The `*.realzellij.test.ts` suites need a binary: set `NODETERM_TEST_ZELLIJ=/abs/path/zellij`
or put `zellij` on PATH; they sandbox HOME, XDG and `ZELLIJ_SOCKET_DIR`, and skip otherwise.

**A test's temp directory must go away when the run does.** `fakePlatform()`'s `userDataDir` is made
on first read under one per-run root (`test/setup/fake-platform-root.ts`), and that root is removed
after the last test file finishes. It used to be one `mkdtemp` in the system temp dir per call, never
removed, and a development server collected ~395,000 of them until `/tmp` ran out of inodes and whole
runs failed with ENOSPC. If you `mkdtemp` in a test yourself, remove it in `afterEach`/`afterAll`
— or, for the `userDataDir` of a `CorePlatform` you build by hand, call `makeFakeUserDataDir()`,
which lands under the same root.

**Beyond `fakePlatform()`, a test cleans up every temp directory it creates.** The suite once left ~1,500 directories in
`/tmp` per full run, and on a shared box that exhausted the filesystem's inodes and broke every
other session's builds. Use `testTmpDir(prefix)` from `src/core/test-tmp.ts` (removed when the file
ends, even when a test failed), or `rmSync(dir, { recursive: true, force: true })` in
`afterEach`/`afterAll`/`finally`; stop servers and children writing there first. Every run points
`os.tmpdir()` at a private sandbox (`test/setup/tmp-sandbox.ts`), and the run exits non-zero naming
each prefix still in it — `NODETERM_TEST_KEEP_TMP=1` keeps the sandbox so you can see what wrote
there. A module-level cache of `platform().userDataDir` is the other way a dir comes back: a suite
that boots two cores keeps writing into the first one's removed directory.
On macOS the sandbox is rooted at `/tmp`, not the per-user `TMPDIR`: that one is ~57 characters
realpath'd, and a socket like `nodeterm-session-host-<16 hex>.sock` under it overflows the
103-character unix-socket limit (`listen EINVAL`, 21 suites red on a stock Mac).

**An `infinite` CSS animation is a frame loop, and it runs whether or not anyone is looking.** A
running animation makes the compositor produce a frame every vsync — 120/s on a ProMotion display —
and re-raster the window each time; measured on a 40-terminal canvas, ONE visible pulsing node took
idle CPU from 1.5 % to 33 %, and twenty took it to 101 %. The cost is paid once for the window, so
the step is at the FIRST animation, not the twentieth. Two consequences when you add one: give it
`animation-play-state: var(--nt-anim-state);` right after the shorthand so it joins the idle-window
gate (`src/renderer/styles.animation-gate.test.ts` fails if you forget, because one ungated
animation takes the whole win back), and prefer a static state to a pulse wherever the pulse is not
carrying information the user needs at a glance. The full measurement table and the reasoning are
in CLAUDE.md § Idle energy.

## Pull requests

- Branch from `main`. CI runs `quality` and `quality-windows`; keep both green (`main` has no branch
  protection, so nothing enforces it for you). `security.yml` also runs CodeQL and
  Dependency review, byte-identical to upstream's. They were removed while the repo was private
  (both need GitHub Advanced Security there, and a private repo without it answers with a failing
  upload, not a skipped scan) and came back once it went public, where both are free.
- Explain **why**, not just what. If a decision has a trade-off, name it and say what you rejected.
- If you measured something, put the numbers in — they save the next person the same afternoon.
- Say what you did **not** verify. That is more useful than a confident summary.
- **Lead with what changed and why it matters.** A reviewer who reads only your first two
  sentences should be able to decide whether to keep reading; implementation detail comes after.
- **Match the length to the change.** A one line fix gets a paragraph, a change that moves a
  boundary gets as much room as it needs, and neither is improved by headings it does not need.

## Documentation

Two files, two audiences:

- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** (this file) — what another human needs before touching the code.
- **`CLAUDE.md` + `.claude/rules/*.md`** — the deep invariants, with the reasoning and the
  measurements. The root holds what applies to every change and a routing table; each rule file
  holds one subsystem and declares (`paths:` frontmatter) which source files it covers, so a coding
  agent loads it only when it touches that code. A new deep invariant goes into the rule file whose
  `paths` own the code; if you add, move or rename a source file, check the globs still reach it.
  `.claude/rules/` is the only tracked part of `.claude/`.

**If you change or discover something other contributors must know, update this file too.** An
invariant that only lives in a commit message is one refactor away from being violated by someone
who never saw it.

**Windows text submission waits for the composer.** Use `core/settled-text.ts` for native PTY and
session-host `sendText`: adjacent paste/Enter writes can be consumed in one read. The bounded
screen check may leave text unsubmitted; propagate `pasted-not-submitted` all the way to the
caller and tell the user to inspect the terminal. Never treat that truthy string as success or
automatically retry the paste. True means the requested writes completed, not that a turn began.
The versioned `sendKeysV2` host request refuses old hosts without fallback or restart. Collapsed
or hidden pastes may need manual Enter; device testing remains necessary.

An unanswered Claude `AskUserQuestion` is correlated by session and tool-use ID in the core
mirror, independently of its short-lived display stash. Ordinary hooks, subagent activity and
unrelated transcript results must not clear attention or archive its inbox card. Both shells
use `recordQuestionResult` for transcript rescue (including Escape/decline), and broadcast the
mirror's effective event. Keep result IDs through local and SSH tails; a boolean “some tool
finished” is insufficient. Explicit new user turns, interrupts and session boundaries reset it.

Remote Codex account safety (#736): managed SSH Codex sessions and agent-less login terminals
require a known safe account id and a safe resolved remote home before spawning. The remote env
builder supplies their private `CODEX_HOME`; never fall back to the system login when that scope
is unavailable. System SSH Codex retains the host environment, including during early attach
before home discovery; never inject a guessed `HOME` or `CODEX_HOME`. Custom Codex harnesses use
the same guard. Desktop supports remote account lifecycle; the Server browser still explicitly
rejects managed Codex account management.

- Media URLs live for the app run. Remote cache pruning must keep files already handed to
  players; the cache cap is soft until restart. Use the existing `video` node for audio too.
- Subagent reload replay is display-only and current-host-only. Never replay status/permission
  events or treat a replayed card as verified process ownership; subscribe before taking its snapshot.

**Phone consent belongs to the verified handshake, not the browse socket.** A standing phone's
SAS request survives transport closure only until its 120-second deadline; approval requires the
issued id and displayed box key together. Keep request/reply outcomes distinct (stale request,
failed pin save, missing IPC response, saved-but-disconnected). All production pin/revoke writers
must use `updateApprovedDevices` for the whole read/modify/write, so concurrent updates cannot
lose approvals or resurrect revoked keys. Server Edition does not host this legacy relay path.

Managed Codex login terminals are agent-less: core identifies their provider from the saved
account list. Before opening one, await `useSettings.getState().flush()` after adding the account.
The normal 300 ms coalesced save is too late: an unknown id can launch against the system home.

Claude subagent cards come from Claude's native `SubagentStart`/`SubagentStop` whenever a session
sends them; the `Agent`/`Task` tool pairing stays as the fallback and the task-label source. Both
shells pass every normalized event, and the `<task-notification>` end, through the one
`ClaudeSubagentLifecycle` before any consumer, and start the native tail before the child-event
gate. A consumer that keys subagents by id must honour `supersedes`. A native stop is not always
the final end (a background child is resumed under the same id), so Eco safety rides the parent
`Stop`'s `background_tasks` inventory, not the card alone. Measure a CLI change against real
payloads (`__fixtures__/claude/subagent-hook-payloads.json`) before changing any of this.

Claude child `PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse`/`PostToolUseFailure` hooks must not drive parent state.
Child `PermissionRequest` and attention `Notification` hooks still reach needs-you and phone
approvals, including the raw approval summary and deterministic reply ticket. Keep raw summary
recording before the child transcript-association guard in both shells.

A held parent question can overlap child permissions: retain its question card and waiting
state while publishing each approval ticket separately. Approval replies resolve only their
own ticket; the picker stays pending until its correlated answer or explicit reset.
When the parent answers first, retain concurrent approval tickets and blocked attention until
their own replies; ordinary tool activity cannot settle them. Explicit turn/session resets
still cancel both kinds of pending attention.

Optional hook ownership failures must never stop Desktop window creation or Server boot. Use the
shared nonfatal startup path and surface its actionable diagnostic. A responding HTTP port is not
nodeterm identity: verify bearer acceptance and rejection. Legacy SSH endpoint migration requires
ownership proof, an unchanged-file check, and stdin-only credential transfer; a project name alone
is not permission to replace another installation's advertisement.

Held approval attention must not replace subagent, recurring or background-task events, or refresh
state evidence from those lifecycle hooks. A parent may ask several questions while a child ticket
is outstanding: track each new picker and preserve child approval cards independently, including
when their display titles match. Answering either resolves only that question or ticket.

SSH Codex metrics must stay scoped to the host and account being read. Credentials and quota
HTTP requests remain on that host; only sanitized usage returns over SSH. Never route a failed
remote context lookup into a local transcript reader, or reuse Claude's token formula/window
estimate for Codex. The system account follows the host login environment; managed accounts
use their validated private home. Usage refresh must not start or repair a shared Codex daemon.

Delayed Windows message submission must recheck the attested child process/birth AND emulator
paste mode immediately before Enter, not just the surviving PTY root. A missing host reply after
a transmitted text request is uncertain delivery, never a pre-paste refusal; show the no-resend
warning. SessionStart idle rescue is scoped to that same nonempty session and agent identity,
and a foreign idle must not broadcast fresh state proof to the renderer.

Control and linked-context fallback must keep a known node identity on the endpoint family the
session was born on. A foreign server being reachable is not evidence that it owns the canvas —
and a matching token is not proof either (on an SSH host the token dir is shared per unix
account); it is a routing rule, and the server still authorizes. Take the reference token from the
primary endpoint's own dir, never from a global directory, and match each candidate's own dir
against it — by value, or, when the reference is empty, by the directory's real path (an empty
value matches every stranger). Probe a fallback candidate (bounded) before posting to it, but never put a timeout on
the real POST: a confirm-gated verb waits for a human. Keep real owning-endpoint refusals final and
legacy hook delivery unchanged. When no owner answers, say so once, as a temporary state
(`FOREIGN_ENDPOINT_HINT`); never let another instance's "permanent, do not retry" stand in for a
dropped tunnel.
