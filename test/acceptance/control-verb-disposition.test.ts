/**
 * THE REGRESSION GUARD THIS FEATURE NEVER HAD, and the reason it could regress twice unnoticed.
 *
 * Canvas control routes by SOURCE: the request names the agent's own node, and the dispatch has to
 * find which canvas owns it. When that is not the canvas on screen, the answer used to be
 * `travelToProject` — the tab switched, the owning project's SAVED viewport was applied, and the
 * human's focus, camera and typing context were taken by a call they did not make. Two carve-outs
 * were added over time (the cold open for `open-*`, then the display verbs) and each was written
 * as if it were the last one, because nothing anywhere walked the WHOLE verb table. Twenty-one
 * verbs still travelled, `close` among them, which is the field report that finally named it.
 *
 * CROSS-LAYER on purpose, which is why it lives here rather than in `src/`: the verb table is
 * main's (`ControlVerb` belongs to the main-side verb model — see the header of
 * `src/shared/control-verbs.ts` for why it stays there), the disposition is the renderer's, and
 * production layering forbids the renderer importing core. Walking one against the other is
 * exactly what neither side can do alone, and it is the only thing that makes "every verb" a
 * checked claim instead of a list someone kept up to date by hand.
