// TEST-ONLY — the run-wide temp sandbox and the leak guard. See `src/core/test-tmp.ts` for why.
//
// `setup` runs in vitest's main process before any worker exists, so every worker — and every child
// process a test spawns with the inherited environment — sees `os.tmpdir()` resolve INSIDE one
// private directory. `teardown` runs after every worker is done: whatever is still in there is a
// directory some test created and never removed, and the run FAILS (non-zero exit) naming it by
// prefix. The sandbox
// is removed either way, so a leak costs this run a red result instead of costing the machine inodes.
//
// Registered AFTER `tmux-sandbox.ts` on purpose: that sandbox is created from the real temp dir,
// where its socket-length budget was measured, not from inside this one.
//
// Windows: the sandbox is still entered and removed, but leftovers are reported as a warning rather
// than a failure. A file a just-exited child still holds (or Defender is scanning) is EBUSY there for
// a moment after the test that created it cleaned up, which is a false leak this guard cannot tell
// apart from a real one; the POSIX runs (ubuntu CI + every dev box) carry the enforcement.
