- **Kanban view** (`components/kanban/KanbanView.tsx`; toggle is a Trello-style icon ON the
  **active project tab** (`.tab__board-toggle`, after the name, before the caret — the view
  belongs to the project; earlier homes were the tab-strip end, then the controls-cluster,
  both rejected in use) plus ⌘⇧B / ⌘K): per-project
  full-page board OVER the canvas. It is **dual-source** (PR #90): SESSION cards are the project's
  session nodes (React Flow type `terminal`), derived LIVE from the canvas nodes
  (title/color/kind/agentId), with RUNNING / NEEDS YOU badges + unread dot from the default
  `agentStatus` store (click = back to canvas + `focusNodeById`); GITHUB cards are the repo's
  issues (`GitHubIssueCardView` via `state/githubIssues.ts`, opened through
  `GitHubIssueSummaryModal`, a column move that closes/reopens the issue confirms first). A
  **source filter** (`KanbanSourceFilter`: All / GitHub / Sessions) and a transient per-board
  **label filter** narrow what shows.
  **Where a card comes from is a registry, not a branch per call site** (`renderer/lib/kanbanSources.ts`,
  2026-08-30 — the same membership-plus-one-leaf discipline `AGENT_CONFIG` uses): each entry declares
  its filter `label`, its `placement` (`assignment` = the board's own persisted assignments,
  reorderable within a column; `provider` = the provider reports the column, the board persists
  nothing and a move is the provider's write), its in-column `lane` order and whether it is
  `configured` for a given board. Two orders live there deliberately: **declaration order is the
  source filter's button order** (All · GitHub · Sessions), **`lane` is the in-column stacking order**
  (sessions above issues) — they genuinely differ, and pinning both is what stops either being
  re-spelled elsewhere. `KanbanColumn` therefore takes ONE `lanes` prop (`{sourceId, cards, footer?,
  count}`) instead of a `cards` + eight `github*` props, places them via `byLane` and names no source;
  the board builds each source's leaf, and the drag union branches on `placement` (`isProviderDrag`)
  rather than on the string `'github'`. A lane's `count` is passed rather than derived from
  `cards.length` because a provider reports a server-side total larger than the page fetched so far.
  What deliberately did NOT move into the registry: the virtual **Ungrouped** column (board
  semantics, not a source's concern) and `validKanban`, which stays the single shape gate on every
  load path — a registry entry must never grow its own parallel validation. **Labels** are a per-project palette (`ProjectKanban` labels,
  edited inline via the Notion-style `LabelPicker`: create/assign/rename/recolor/delete through the
  pure `lib/kanban.ts` transforms) plus each GitHub issue's own labels, both filterable. The canvas stays MOUNTED under the opaque overlay (agent-status
  listeners live in Canvas.tsx; `display:none` would 0×0-resize every terminal into a tmux
  SIGWINCH), and canvas-only shortcuts (undo, ⌘T/⌘⇧C, Delete) early-return via `isKanbanOpen`.
  Board data is `project.kanban` ({columns, assignments: [{nodeId, columnId}]}, order = array
  order) in `.nodeterm/project.json` — git-shared, rides rev/mirror/watcher; absent until the
  first edit (`defaultKanban` seeds To Do / In Progress / Done). The virtual **Ungrouped**
  column (never persisted, undeletable/unrenamable, always first) holds every session with no —
  or dangling — assignment, in canvas order, so the board never opens empty. **Assignment is
  board metadata only**: drags never move canvas nodes or change groups; dead nodes' assignments
  prune lazily on each board change (`pruneAssignments`). Column delete is confirm-free (cards
  return to Ungrouped; no last-column rule — Ungrouped remains). The one shape rule is
  `validKanban` (`core/workspace-files.ts`), applied on EVERY load path — `fileToProject` AND
  `loadV3`'s inline (cwd-less) branch, which bypasses fileToProject — so a v1 `{columns, cards}`
  or hand-mangled board drops to the fresh default instead of crashing the render (view choice
  persists in localStorage, so a render throw would boot-loop). Pure transforms in
  `renderer/lib/kanban.ts`; view choice is personal (`state/viewMode.ts`, localStorage
  `nodeterm.projectView`). The board opens with a **title strip** (`.kanban-header`: project
  dot + name) whose height clears the floating controls-cluster icons — columns never sit under
  them. **Cards collapse/expand on single click** (transient state); the expanded detail row
  reuses `ContextMeter` (model + % pill, per the node header) + session chip + an ↗
  open-on-canvas button; double-click opens the node directly. Z-order contract: overlay 25 <
  `.controls-cluster` 26 (Explorer/SC/Settings stay clickable ON the board) < `.top-banners` 27
  (a mandatory-update card must not hide behind the board) < tabbar 30. An assigned session
  node shows its column as a **half-pill flush on the node's TOP edge** — see the pill sentence
  below. A card's ↗ / double-click opens the **card modal** (`components/kanban/CardModal.tsx`, body
  portal on the dialog-stack, scrim z 55, scrim/Esc close — Esc in CAPTURE phase, and an Esc
  during a header rename only cancels the edit). Terminal cards get a LIVE second view of the
  tmux session (`ModalTerminal.tsx`): the pty subscriber ledger is keyed by the composite
  `(ClientId, viewerId ?? PRIMARY)` (`core/pty-manager.ts` — **viewer identity**; viewerId is an
  optional TRAILING arg through preload/ws-bridge/LocalTransport, absent = bit-for-bit legacy, and
  a client's per-connection socket pause survives a single view's departure). The modal viewer
  seed-paints from the joiner screen (`toXtermText` transforms — raw capture-pane staircases),
  handles fresh-cold via scrollback snapshot + hint (agent auto-resume stays canvas-only), has
  deliberately no park/WebGL/hover/flow-control, and kills ONLY its own viewer on close. Sticky
  cards edit their text in the modal (live both ways).
  The modal header carries the terminal node's actions (search via `useTerminalSearch`+
  `FindBar` on the modal xterm; dictate via the same `nodeterm:dictate` event — `.dictation`
  overlay z is 60, ABOVE the modal scrim; ✦ `pty.generateName` through the modal rename funnel).
  **The 💬 icon means COMMENTS on both surfaces** (repurposed from the markdown view — ⌘M still
  toggles markdown/chat on the canvas node): on a terminal node it opens a right-side comments
  flyout (`.term-node__comments`, a sibling of the overflow:hidden root, hosting BoardLogPanel
  with `card: Pick<KanbanSession,'id'>`); in the modal it collapses/reopens the panel, which is
  OPEN BY DEFAULT there. Under the modal header sits the **card metadata strip** (`CardMetaBar.tsx`): Members (assign) —
  colored initial avatars, picker pool = me + live presence peers + board-log authors (name-keyed,
  NO separate membership system) — and a Due date (`datetime-local`, red Overdue chip past due;
  cards show mini avatars + a due chip). Data = `kanban.meta [{nodeId, assignees, dueAt, priority}]` (priority low/medium/high/urgent, colored chips)
  (tolerant readers via `cardMeta`; pruned with dead nodes; empty entries dropped). Assign/due
  changes are logged through the SAME diff funnel (`member-assigned/unassigned`, `due-set/cleared`,
  `priority-set/cleared`; agent-to-agent message deliveries are logged as `agent-message` by
  `agent-message-trace.recordDelivery`, where `from`/`to` are node ids and `title` is the outcome;
  unknown future event types render neutrally — the `BoardLogEvent.type` union in `shared/types.ts`
  is the source of truth). Feed rows show ABSOLUTE Trello-style stamps
  (relative in the tooltip). The modal's right third is the **board log** panel (`BoardLogPanel.tsx`, `state/boardLog.ts`):
  per-person comments + card activity from `<cwd>/.nodeterm/board-log.jsonl` — append-only JSONL
  (`core/board-log.ts`: tolerant newest-first parse cap 500; text clamped `BOARD_LOG_TEXT_MAX`
  16KB — an SSH append is ONE printf arg, ARG_MAX would silently drop it), author = presence
  identity, registered via `core/board-log-handlers.ts` in BOTH shells (client sends only a
  projectId — the path always derives from the server's own registry, no jail needed). Events
  come from ONE pure funnel (`lib/boardLogDiff.ts` — binding invariant: its `cardTitle` arg
  returns '' for and ONLY for dead nodes; column deletion suppresses per-card moved-to-Ungrouped
  noise; prunes/reorders log nothing) + `createNodeInColumn`'s card-created. Local projects push
  changes via fs.watch; desktop SSH projects poll 5s while subscribed; inline projects show a
  hint. Relay tabs BRIDGE boardLog to the host (pre-dispatch `sharedProjectId` scope guard in the
  relay dispatch — an out-of-scope projectId is refused before any registry/path resolution; a
  connection drop replays its outstanding onChanged unsubscribes). Deliberate v1 gaps: column-level
  events are stored but no card feed shows them; canvas-born nodes get no card-created; no
  card-deleted type.
  Per-column "+ New session" menus create agents/terminal/sticky nodes assigned to the column
  (assignment written UN-pruned — the fresh node isn't in the derived list yet). The column
  half-pill itself: (`components/kanban/ColumnPill.tsx`, `columnForNode` in lib/kanban; rendered
  as a SIBLING of the node root — the roots are overflow:hidden — hidden for Ungrouped/dangling,
  click opens the board). Server Edition works as-is (pure renderer + workspace.save). Scope: no
  agent-driven card movement yet, no board undo, mobile N/A.
