## Terminal session continuity (tmux)

`src/core/pty-manager.ts` runs each terminal inside a persistent tmux session
(`tmux new-session -A -D -s nt-<nodeId>`) on a dedicated socket (`-L node-terminal`) with
a generated config (`-f <userData>/tmux.conf`, so the user's `~/.tmux.conf` never
interferes; status bar off, **mouse on**, 50k history, `set-clipboard on` + `terminal-features
",*:clipboard"`, and the copy-mode mouse bindings). Because the tmux *server* outlives the app,
sessions survive when no client is attached. `src/shared/ssh.ts`'s `remoteTmuxConf` is the same
config for an SSH project's remote tmux.

**Every REMOTE tmux invocation starts with `remoteTmuxPathPrologue()`** (`shared/ssh.ts` — PATH
**append**: `/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, `/opt/local/bin`, `$HOME/.local/bin`): an ssh
exec channel gets a non-login shell, and on a macOS host Homebrew's `shellenv` lives in
`~/.zprofile`, so a host whose own terminal runs tmux fine answered
`zsh:1: command not found: tmux` to every command of ours (issue #449 — the same class as the
remote claude probe's login-shell + PATH fix). Append, never prepend: a PATH that already resolves
tmux keeps exactly that binary, so nothing re-pairs a long-lived tmux server with a different
client build. When tmux is genuinely absent the interactive spawn (`tmuxOrExplain`,
`control-master.ts`) prints what is missing, how to install it and what a tmux-less remote loses,
then degrades to a plain login shell — mirroring the local plain-shell fallback; the raw
`command not found` line must never be the user-facing error again.

**tmux owns the mouse — scrolling, selection, and the alternate screen are all its job.** This is
the native behavior, and it is deliberate:
- **The wheel scrolls tmux's own history** (`history-limit`), not the emulator's buffer.
- **The pane is on the alternate screen** (`\e[?1049h`) — capabilities are NOT blanked — which is
  what keeps a full-screen TUI's input box *put* instead of scrolling away with the text.
- **Selection is tmux copy-mode.** A drag copies; apps that request mouse tracking themselves
  (vim, htop) still get their own mouse events — tmux forwards those regardless.

**Do not take scrolling away from tmux again.** A previous design did exactly that (`mouse off` +
`terminal-overrides ',*:smcup@:rmcup@:indn@'` to keep tmux on the *normal* screen, so its output
flowed into xterm's scrollback, which was then hydrated from `tmux capture-pane` on reattach). It
failed structurally: **tmux is a screen PAINTER, not a stream.** Every redraw (attach, resize,
refresh) erases and repaints, so blank and duplicated rows leaked into the emulator's scrollback —
users saw black bands and duplicated screens when scrolling up — and the pane stopped behaving
natively. The hydration that design needed is gone (see the reattach seeding below).

**Copy → the system clipboard, via OSC 52.** `set-clipboard on` **plus** `set -as terminal-features
",*:clipboard"`: on copy, tmux emits OSC 52 to the attached client, and the renderer's OSC 52
handler (`parseOsc52` in `terminal/osc52.ts`, applied in `TerminalNode.tsx`) writes the system
clipboard. Two traps, both measured on
tmux 3.4:
- **The `terminal-overrides ',xterm*:Ms=…'` entry does NOT work on tmux 3.2+** — with it, a copy
  emitted **zero** OSC 52 to the client. `terminal-features` is what actually enables the sequence.
  Do not "fix" the `Ms=` override back; it is why copying from SSH sessions never worked.
- **No `pbcopy` pipe.** The copy-mode bindings are bare `copy-pipe-and-cancel` (no command): piping
  to `pbcopy` was macOS-only, and over SSH it would have copied on the *remote* host anyway. OSC 52
  is cross-platform and works over SSH.

**A tmux client is not necessarily a watcher.** `SessionInfo.clients` is a COUNT
(`#{session_attached}`), never a boolean, because one session can hold several: the app's painter,
the user's own `tmux -L node-terminal attach`, a second nodeterm on the same socket, and our own
**control-mode shadows** (`PtyManager.shadowAttach`, used for background writes without spawning a
painter). The session reaper subtracts ours via the `shadowed` seam — a shadow is a real client but
not a watcher, so a shadowed session must stay exactly as cullable as an idle detached one.

The count is carried numerically rather than collapsed at parse time **because the subtraction
needs it**: a session holding our shadow AND a real client must still read as attached, and a
boolean could only be forced to false — reaping the session out from under whoever that other
client belongs to. **Any future reader of `list-clients` / `session_attached` owes the same
subtraction.**

Lifecycle, by intent:
- **Offscreen release (in place, 2026-08-11)** → a mounted node fully offscreen past
  `settings.offscreenTerminalMinutes` detaches its PTY client and disposes its xterm without
  unmounting (plate shown; tmux keeps running; reattach-redraw on approach, measured <500 ms).
  See the Terminal node lifecycle section for the two invariants (mount-stable observer;
  `session.source` remote gate). Note the released node is a DETACHED tmux session — it joins
  the session reaper's candidate pool (6 h grace still protects it).
- **Every memory lever must ask whether the kill ends live work** (`terminal/live-work.ts`). The
  renderer reclaims terminal memory in FOUR places — park window expiry, the park's LRU cap, the
  memory-pressure drop (all three in `park-budget.ts`) and the offscreen viewer release
  (`offscreen-policy.ts`) — and all four were written as if dropping a PTY client were free,
  because "the tmux session keeps running and re-attach redraws". **That sentence is only true
  where tmux is actually underneath.** On the plain-shell fallback (no tmux installed, tmux
  switched off in settings, or an install path `findTmux` missed) the pty IS the shell, so the
  identical call kills it and everything under it — an agent CLI mid-turn included. Issue #126: a
  project switch terminated a working Claude agent, which then auto-resumed from wherever the kill
  landed. The predicate is deliberately the narrowest one that closes it — a tmux-backed session is
  never protected (the kill costs a redraw), and neither is a plain terminal, a finished agent or
  an unknown state (nothing is running to lose). **A fifth lever owes the same gate.**
  The fifth is the offscreen release of an ARMED node (`--after`, `shouldDeferReleaseForHeldLaunch`,
  2026-09-02): the held launch is delivered by session NAME, so with tmux underneath the release is
  harmless and the node stays `sessionReady` (the teardown keeps the flag for an offscreen release
  of a tmux-backed session); on the plain-shell fallback the release would destroy the very pane
  the launch is typed into, so it is deferred while armed. MEASURED before the fix: a released
  QUEUED node held its launch through its dependency going `done`, the badge claimed the terminal
  "has not started yet", and only a camera travel (revive) ever fired it — "the chain works when I
  look at it" was this.
- **Node unmount (project switch)** → the RENDERER **parks** the terminal (`TerminalNode.tsx`
  `parkedTerminals`): the xterm instance + its attached PTY stay alive with the `.xterm` element
  detached from the DOM, so a remount within `TERM_PARK_MS` (5 min) re-adopts them — instant, and
  exact (the tmux client never detaches, so mouse-tracking/alternate-screen modes and scrollback
  carry over; do NOT "optimize" this into a respawn+redraw — a fresh xterm on a reused client
  misses the attach-time mode sequences and breaks scrolling). The park timer then runs the real
  teardown: `kill()` detaches the PTY client; the tmux session keeps running. WebGL contexts are
  **viewport-scoped and budgeted** (browsers cap ~16 live contexts, and a canvas holds far more
  terminals). A per-terminal `IntersectionObserver` (`rootMargin` pre-announces approach) only
  REPORTS visibility to a **module-level budget coordinator** (`terminal/webgl-budget.ts`) that owns
  every grant decision and all timing: it keeps the contexts WE hold at/under the live budget
  (`WEBGL_BUDGET` 12 default — the browser Server Edition; on DESKTOP main raises Chromium's cap
  itself via `--max-active-webgl-contexts` = 32 and boot raises the budget to 24 via
  `setWebglBudget`, constants in `src/shared/webgl.ts`) so
  the browser never has to **force-evict** — which is the bug that flashed Chromium's dead
  "lost context" placeholder (white box + sad-face) on a visible terminal during a fast pan / zoom
  out, because the old per-node observers each acquired independently and momentarily overshot the
  cap. Rules: a client granted only after an **acquire debounce** (`WEBGL_ACQUIRE_DEBOUNCE_MS`, so a
  pan-through never grabs a context for a two-frame flash); if granting would exceed the budget,
  **reclaim on demand from the least-recently-visible HIDDEN holder** (`hiddenAt` LRU order);
  if every holder is currently visible (zoomed way out), the newcomer is NOT granted and **stays on
  the DOM renderer** — we never push past the budget. A hidden holder keeps its context
  **indefinitely** (warm for a pan-back of any length) — there is no time-based release; it is
  reclaimed strictly on demand, either by a visible newcomer that needs its slot or by
  `releaseAllHiddenGrants` (queued through the drain) under memory pressure. `acquire()`
  returning false (WebGL2 unavailable) doesn't burn a slot; an externally-lost context
  (`onContextLoss`) is reported via `handle.contextLost()`, drops from the accounting, and — for a
  still-VISIBLE client — schedules ONE delayed budget-gated re-grant (sleep/wake GPU resets lose
  every context at once with no visibility change; without this every woken terminal sat on the
  DOM renderer until panned out and back). The NODE still never re-acquires itself (that loop is
  the eviction fight the design fears): the retry goes through `tryGrant` — never exceeds the
  budget, never reclaims a visible holder — and stops after `WEBGL_LOSS_STREAK_MAX` consecutive
  losses (visibility transition resets). The node registers via `registerWebglClient` on mount
  and `handle.dispose()`s on unmount (which releases + cancels timers). A parked terminal is
  off-screen so it holds no context. Permanent-delete paths call `disposeTerminalOnUnmount(id)` so a
  deleted node disposes instead of parking.
  **A renderer released while the node is unmeasurable mismeasures its own row spacing**
  (`terminal/dom-renderer-spacing.ts`): `WebglAddon.dispose()` is also the back-to-DOM-renderer
  path, and it runs from the lifecycle effect's CLEANUP — after React detached the element — so the
  fresh DOM renderer derives `letter-spacing` from a width cache whose `offsetWidth` is **0** and
  bakes in a whole extra cell per character. That is the "letters drift apart for a split second
  after a project switch": the adopting mount paints wide until the WebGL grant lands 150 ms later.
  Focus mode's `display:none` wrapper is the same shape. xterm re-derives the spacing on a char-size
  / dpr / options change and **not on a resize**, so nothing in the reattach path heals it —
  `applyFit` calls the change-gated `resyncDomRendererSpacing(term)`, which bails while the
  measurement is still 0 rather than re-baking the wrong number.
  **Which renderer a terminal uses** is `settings.terminalGpuRendering`, resolved by the single
  resolver `resolveTerminalRenderer(value)` (`src/shared/webgl.ts`) to `dom | webgl | shared`:
  `'off'` = xterm's DOM renderer, `'on'` = one budgeted WebGL context per terminal (everything the
  paragraph above describes), `'shared'` = **glyphgrid**, ONE canvas-wide WebGL2 context every
  terminal paints into (`src/renderer/glyphgrid/`, reached through `terminal/glyphgrid-attach.ts`;
  the per-terminal budget is OFF in this mode). `'auto'` (the default, and what legacy/unknown values
  fall back to) = **`webgl` on EVERY platform**, macOS included. The macOS branch has moved twice:
  it was `dom`, then `shared` on 2026-08-05 (per-terminal WebGL composited terminals black after
  zoom-out bursts, blamed on the OS compositor), and is now `webgl` — the blackout was root-caused
  not to context count but to a dependency skew (addon-webgl 0.19's dispose crashed on the 5.5 core
  and aborted its own DOM-renderer restore; pinned + healed, see
  `renderer/terminal/webgl-addon-pair.test.ts`). What actually guards macOS is a lower budget,
  `WEBGL_BUDGET_DESKTOP_MAC` (16, vs 24 elsewhere), capping compositor pressure at every zoom. The
  four-way setting stays as the escape hatch: `'shared'` is now opt-in only (also where the macOS
  default points back if the one unconfirmed 2026-07-30 whole-window-flicker report recurs), and
  `'off'` drops GPU rendering entirely.
- **Window close / app quit** → clients detach (`PtyManager.killAll()`); the tmux session keeps
  running. `killAll()` deliberately does NOT kill sessions.
- **Node reopen / app relaunch** (nothing parked) → a new PTY attaches to the same
  `nt-<nodeId>` session and tmux redraws current state.
- **User clicks ×** → `destroy(persistKey)` runs `tmux kill-session`, permanently ending it. For a
  REMOTE node it kills the remote session **and then the local one of the same name** — normally a
  no-op, but it reaps the orphan the pre-`requireRemote` local fallback below could leave behind.
- **A remote node is NEVER spawned locally** (`PtyCreateOptions.requireRemote`). `sshRemote` says
  "here is the master to run over"; `requireRemote` says "and if there isn't one, spawn NOTHING".
  Without it, a create with no `sshRemote` falls through to core's local tmux/plain-shell branches
  — which is how an SSH project's terminal opened while the ControlMaster was down (no network,
  host unreachable, `ssh` missing) quietly became a LOCAL shell in the local `$HOME`: same node id,
  same `SSH user@host` header chip, the REMOTE session's scrollback snapshot replayed into it, and
  — for an agent node — a cold-restore `claude --resume <remote session id>` running on the wrong
  machine under the local account, leaving an orphaned local `nt-<id>` behind. Refused on both
  sides: the renderer never calls `create` when `resolveSshRemote` came back empty
  (`CoState.offline` + the node's Reconnect button), and core refuses in `spawnNew`
  (`PtyCreateResult.unavailable`) so a master that dies inside the round-trip can't sneak through.
  The refusal is **only** in `spawnNew` — a co-attach JOIN to a live session for that node id is
  still correct. An offline node reports itself to `SshReconnector`, so the canvas heals itself;
  `retryNow` (banner Reconnect / node Reconnect) skips the backoff and clears the refuse window.
- **"Restart agent (resume)"** → deliberately NOT a session lifecycle event: `terminal/
  agent-restart.ts` restarts the agent CLI *inside* the pane and leaves the PTY, the tmux session
  and its scrollback untouched. It exists for **new-model pickup** — a freshly released model only
  shows up in a CLI's model list on a fresh launch, and doing that by hand means closing and
  re-resuming every agent node on the canvas. Choreography: write the CLI's own exit line (`/exit`
  for claude, `/quit` for codex — that table is also the gate, an agent not in it can never be
  restarted in place), poll `pty:pane-command` (`#{pane_current_command}`, local tmux socket or the
  project's SSH ControlMaster; any failure reads as "not a shell yet") every `RESTART_POLL_MS`
  (250 ms) until a SHELL owns the pane, then echo-deliver `resumeCommand(...)` — the same
  `claude --resume` / `codex resume` the cold restore uses. **Nothing is ever killed**: if the CLI
  has not quit within `RESTART_EXIT_TIMEOUT_MS` (6 s) the run reports `exit-timeout` and leaves the
  session running. A `working` **or `blocked`** session is refused — `/exit` typed into a
  permission prompt would ANSWER it, not quit — and a node is held one-restart-at-a-time until the
  resume line has actually LEFT the pane (an un-submitted line is where a second `/exit` would be
  spliced in). The bulk action runs the same per-node closure sequentially over every idle agent
  node in canvas order and reports one summary line. `performRestartResume` is now a COMPOSITION of
  `performExitPhase` + `performResumePhase` (2026-08-12, behavior-pinned split) — hibernation
  drives the halves separately; each half refuses independently.
- **Agent hibernation ("Eco", 2026-08-12, OPT-IN default off)** → `settings.agentHibernationEnabled`
  (+ `agentHibernationIdleMinutes`, default 30; Settings → Agents): a 60 s renderer sweep
  (`Canvas`) exits the CLI of up to **2** agent nodes per pass that are hook-idle in state `done`,
  fully offscreen (`isNodeWatched` — an open kanban card modal counts as watched), local, idle ≥
  window, non-recurring, without live subagents (`planHibernation` +
  `lib/hibernationCandidates.ts`, both pure/tested). tmux + shell survive; node shows a clickable
  SLEEPING chip; wake (view / chip / modal open) verifies a SHELL owns the pane
  (`isShellCommand` OR the persisted `hibernatedPane` the exit settled on — nu/pwsh users) before
  the KILL_LINE'd, echo-verified `withPermissionMode(resumeCommand(...))`. Sweep/wake/menu-restart
  share ONE `guardConcurrentRestart` set. Load-bearing rules a refactor must not undo:
  (1) **recurring fact is durable** — both loop-card dismiss surfaces route through
  `lib/loopCard.ts`, which HIDES a cron/schedule card but retains `agentStatus.loop`
  (`dismissed: true`); clearing it would let Eco `/exit` a CLI whose cron wakeup lives in that
  process. (2) **Fire-time re-asks**: still-offscreen, remote, eligibility — a plan-time verdict
  is stale by seconds. (3) `hibernated` **self-heals** on live hook states + SessionStart (never
  on `done` — a late Stop POST must not undo a just-performed hibernate); cold restore (`fresh`)
  clears `hibernated` UNCONDITIONALLY and normally lets auto-resume own the node — **`paused` (see
  below) is what makes that auto-resume itself conditional**, the one deliberate exception: the
  flag it gates is still cleared, only the relaunch is skipped. (4) **Ordering with offscreen
  release**:
  Eco defers the Phase-2 viewer release until the node hibernates (hard cap idle+offscreen), but
  ONLY when the idle clock is known (`idleKnown` — `lastEventAt` is transient, so after an app
  restart nothing can hibernate and deferring would make Eco a memory regression). Eco is
  structurally inert for sessions with no turn in the current app run — documented follow-up.
  The deferral is also unaware of `paused`: a deep-paused node's freshly recycled shell keeps its
  xterm alive until the hard cap, waiting for a hibernation that (being already exited, or having
  no CLI to exit) can never come — a second documented follow-up.
  Device checklist (8 items) in PR #130 — owed before recommending Eco to anyone.
- **"Pause session"** (manual, or via Eco when `settings.agentHibernationPersistAcrossRestart` is
  on) → `agentStatus.paused`, a persisted flag alongside `hibernated` with ONE job: stop a node
  from coming back on its own. Two depths, chosen per node: shallow — identical to an Eco exit
  (`registerAgentPause`'s `pause` closure reuses `performExitPhase`), plus `paused` — or "pause &
  end session" — the same recycle `restartAgentNode(…, restartShell: true)` uses
  (`transport.recycle` + a `respawnNonce` bump), so the node comes back `fresh` next time, with no
  live tmux session to hold memory. Two pure predicates in `terminal/hibernation-policy.ts` pin the
  contract: `shouldColdResume` (a `fresh` mount must not auto-relaunch a paused node — see Cold
  restore above) and `shouldAutoWake` (the mount-timer, visibility-edge, and kanban-card-modal-open
  auto-wake triggers must not fire for a paused node, hibernated or not — only an explicit Resume,
  which reuses the SAME `wakeHibernatedNode` trigger the SLEEPING/PAUSED chip's click uses, so it
  gets the same `WakeInputBuffer` splice protection and retry budget). Pausing an already-hibernated
  node skips the exit phase entirely (`alreadyExited` in the closure) — asking an idle CLI-less
  shell to quit would type `/exit` into it as a real command. `paused` is ALSO excluded from Eco's
  own candidate plan and its exit closure's fire-time re-ask (`HibernationCandidate.paused`,
  `hibernationCandidates.ts`) — a deep-paused node has `hibernated` unset (its tmux was recycled,
  not exited), so `!hibernated` alone would still admit it to a sweep whose dropped SessionEnd hook
  POST left a stale `done` behind: the same `/exit`-into-a-bare-shell mistake `alreadyExited` closes
  on the manual path, closed here on the automatic one. Node menu only today (canvas right-click +
  the sessions sidebar row menu, which shares the same `selectionItems` builder, plus a read-only
  kanban card badge and a clickable one in the card modal); no command palette entry.

The node id is the `persistKey` (passed to `transport.create`), so it must stay stable.
If tmux is unavailable, `PtyManager` falls back to a plain shell (no cross-restart
continuity). `findTmux()` resolves an absolute path because GUI apps don't inherit the
shell PATH, and it tries three sources **in this order: fixed system paths → the shell's
PATH → the tmux the macOS app SHIPS** (`bundledTmuxPath`). System first is deliberate — a
machine that already has tmux keeps using its own, so the bundled copy is a floor, never an
override. `resourcesPath` is `undefined` on the **Server Edition**, so the bundled binary is
unreachable there by construction; a Linux host is expected to have its own. Under
`electron-vite dev` the last candidate resolves against `process.cwd()`, which is where
`scripts/build-tmux.mjs` writes its artifact. If tmux is unavailable from all three,
`PtyManager` still falls back to a plain shell; `TMUX`/`TMUX_PANE` are stripped from the child env to avoid nesting refusal.

### Stale cwd on a warm reattach (issue #464) — tmux's string is a LINUX-only signal

A warm `new-session -A` reattach can land in a session whose shell sits on a DELETED directory
inode (the folder was removed and re-created at the same path, so nothing self-heals and every
prompt prints `getcwd` errors). `PtyManager.paneCwdStale` classifies that through the pure
`classifyPaneCwd` (`src/core/pane-cwd.ts`) and raises the dismissible "Restart in folder" banner.
**The tmux answer only carries the signal on Linux**, where `#{pane_current_path}` passes `/proc`'s
`<path> (deleted)` readlink through. [MEASURED 2026-09-02, tmux 3.7c on macOS 27: darwin's
`osdep-darwin.c` reads the cwd via `proc_pidinfo(PROC_PIDVNODEPATHINFO)` and the kernel keeps
naming the unlinked directory by its old path — the answer is byte-identical before the delete,
after the delete and after the same-named `mkdir`, while `/bin/pwd` inside that pane fails with
`No such file or directory`. The rule that used to live here, "darwin answers an EMPTY string for
an unlinked cwd", was inferred from tmux's source and never ran on a device; CI is Linux+Windows,
so nothing caught it and the banner simply never fired on macOS.] So on darwin the pane's own
process is asked instead: `lsof -a -p <pane pid> -d cwd -FDin` versus the device+inode on disk at
that name, parsed by the pure `lsofCwdLinked`. A positive inode mismatch is the only thing that
answers "unlinked"; anything unreadable degrades to no opinion, and the banner never appears on a
guess. Both signals are proven against a real tmux in `pane-cwd.realtmux.test.ts`, which asserts
the same verdict on both platforms through their different evidence.

**The probe runs BEFORE the tmux client is spawned, and on the POSIX local tmux path nothing is
awaited between `spawnSession` and `spawnNew`'s `return`.** [MEASURED 2026-09-02, tmux
3.7c] tmux paints the attached screen and sends its terminal queries (DA1/DA2/OSC 10/11/`?996n`)
within ~6 ms of attach; `queueData` flushes to the client `FLUSH_MS` (8 ms) later; and the renderer
only registers its `pty:data:<sid>` listener in the continuation of the `pty:create` reply, because
the id is unknowable before it. The first version of this probe ran AFTER the spawn (~50 ms of
`display-message` + `lsof`), so the first flush landed on a channel nobody listened on: paint and
queries dropped, xterm never answered, and tmux waited out its 5.000 s `TTY_QUERY_TIMEOUT` before
redrawing — every project switch past the park window showed blank agent terminals for 5-10 s.
The session exists before the attach (`!fresh` came from `has-session`), so the pane can be asked
first. `pty-reattach-reply-order.test.ts` pins both the ordering and "no output reaches the client
before the create reply". Two sibling paths still await after their spawn and inherit the same
exposure: the dormant Windows warm-tmux confirm (`warmWindowsBackend === 'tmux'`) and the
session-host `ready` barrier; whoever brings them live owes them the same fix. And because every
await before the spawn is a window in which a client can DELETE the node, `spawnNew` re-asks
`liveTombstone` immediately before `spawnSession` (which would otherwise clear the tombstone) —
`create()`'s own check runs before those awaits and cannot see a delete that lands during them. A
tombstone recorded after the create began wins whoever set it (the same client deleting mid-create
is a later intent, not a resurrection); one that predates it stays with `create()`'s owner-exempt
verdict. A create fulfilled without a session (`closed`, `unavailable`) releases parked recycle
waiters like a failure does. Known siblings NOT covered here: a session-host delete records its
tombstone only after the kill acknowledgement, and an SSH delete racing these awaits finds no
registered session and so never kills the remote tmux — both pre-date this change.

### Cold restore (machine reboot)

tmux only survives an **app** restart — a **machine reboot kills the tmux server**, so every
`nt-<nodeId>` session is gone. To bridge that, `create()` returns `PtyCreateResult` with a
`fresh` flag: it runs `tmux has-session` *before* spawning, so `fresh=false` means a warm
reattach (tmux redraws) and `fresh=true` means a cold start (first open OR post-reboot). On a
cold start the renderer (`TerminalNode.tsx`) reconstructs state instead of relying on the dead
session (you can't keep a live OS process across a reboot):
- **Scrollback replay** — `core/scrollback-store.ts` keeps a byte-capped (`256 KB`) snapshot of
  each tmux session's recent output under `<userData>/terminal-scrollback/`, refreshed on a
  timer (`SCROLLBACK_SNAPSHOT_MS`) + on detach/quit (`tmux capture-pane -e`). On a cold start the
  renderer reads it via `pty.readScrollback` and writes it back into xterm (with a "session
  restored" separator). Warm reattach skips it (tmux already redraws). Deleted with the node in
  `destroySession`.
- **Agent resume** — on a cold start of a node whose `agentId` is in `RESUMABLE_AGENTS`, the
  renderer re-launches the agent CLI: `resumeCommand(agentId, sessionId)` (from the session id
  persisted in `agentStatus` localStorage — `claude --resume`, `codex resume`, `gemini
  --resume`) when known, else the bare `launchCmd`. The one-shot `data.initialCommand` still wins
  on the very first open, so the agent is never double-launched. **The one exception: a `paused`
  node** (see "Pause session" below) skips this auto-relaunch — that is the entire point of the
  flag — and instead records the pane its fresh shell settled on (`agentStatus.hibernatedPane`),
  so a later explicit Resume can recognize it even for a default shell outside the wake's
  `isShellCommand` allowlist.
- **An ARMED node must not auto-resume before its held launch has been delivered.** A node opened
  with a `pendingLaunch` (canvas-control `--after`, or a cold-opened node — see
  `.claude/rules/agents-canvas-control.md`) mints its `agentSessionId` at CREATION and holds a
  `claude --session-id <id> …` launch. On its FIRST mount it is `fresh` (no tmux session yet) with
  that minted `priorId` set but NO transcript, so the cold-restore branch here would type
  `claude --resume <id>` into the shell — which prints "No conversation found with session ID: …",
  wastes a CLI start, and then has the real launch delivered on top (screenshot + pane-verified
  2026-09-02). So the cold-restore auto-resume AND the in-place relaunch paths gate on the pure
  `mayRelaunchAgent(data)` (`renderer/lib/pendingLaunch.ts`): `pendingLaunch` present ⇒ never resume;
  once the "Fire armed nodes" effect delivers and clears `pendingLaunch`, a LATER cold restore
  resumes normally (the gate is exactly the flag, nothing more). The minted id is still correct — it
  IS the conversation the launch creates and hooks key on — so the fix is a gate, not a change to the
  assignment.

### We have our own VT emulator — check it before asking tmux

xterm.js is not just a renderer. It parses the pane's output stream, so it **tracks DECSET modes
itself** and exposes them as public API (`term.modes`, `@xterm/xterm/typings/xterm.d.ts:1865`) —
bracketed paste, application-cursor, mouse tracking, origin mode, and the rest. We already read one
of them: `term.modes.mouseTrackingMode` decides whether a click means "follow this file link"
(`src/renderer/terminal/file-links.ts:341`).

We once did the opposite. `PtyManager.bracketPasteRequested` (now **deleted** — see the tombstone
in `pty-manager.ts`) asked **tmux** for the same class of fact, via `#{bracket_paste_flag}` — and
that format **first shipped in tmux 3.7** (2026-06-26). Ubuntu 24.04 LTS ships 3.4, Ubuntu 22.04 →
3.2a, Debian 12/13 → 3.3a/3.5a, Ubuntu 26.04 → 3.6a. On all of those it expanded to `''` exactly
like a bogus name, and the comparison against `'1'` answered **false for every pane**. The bundled
tmux did not rescue it: `extraResources` places it under `"mac"` only, and `bundledTmuxPath` is
deliberately the **last** candidate (see the comment at `pty-manager.ts:245-250` — preferring our
binary would pair a new client with the user's older running *server*, which upstream refuses). On
an **SSH project it was unfixable from our side entirely**: the remote's tmux is whatever the
user's server has.

**The rule this is an instance of: before asking tmux, ssh or `ps` something about a pane, check
whether the emulator already knows it.** Facts about *what the app in the pane is doing* (VT modes,
the alternate screen, the cursor shape it asked for) arrive as bytes we already parse. Facts about
*the session* (does it exist, what is the foreground process group, which panes are in it) are
genuinely tmux's and must be asked. Mixing the two up is how a feature acquires a dependency on a
tmux version we do not control. herdr has no version problem here for exactly this reason — it
reads `mode_get(MODE_BRACKETED_PASTE)` from its own state machine.

**Measured, and the emulator is NOT the answer here.** The `?2004h` a tmux *client* receives is
tmux's own paste-through on the outer terminal (`tty_start_tty`, gated on the outer terminfo
`BE`/`BD`), not the pane app's request: it arrives ~5 ms after attach and reads `true` even for a
pane running `sleep 30`. It never toggled across pane switches, window switches, re-attach or
co-attach. A constant is not a signal — so `term.modes.bracketedPasteMode` cannot stand in for the
pane's state, however tempting the symmetry with `mouseTrackingMode` looks.

**The actual fix is older than the problem: `paste-buffer -p`.** From tmux's own man page — *"If
`-p` is specified, paste bracket control codes are inserted around the buffer **if the application
has requested bracketed paste mode**."* Introduced 2012-03-03, shipped in **tmux 1.7**, so it is
present on every tmux in the field. We do not have to ask whether the app wants framing; we ask
tmux to do the framing, and it applies the pane's real state. Measured on 3.4: framed when the app
requested it, unframed when it did not, correct for a non-active pane, and the whole thing in one
round trip —
`tmux load-buffer -b nt - \; if-shell -F -t <target> '#{pane_in_mode}' 'send-keys -t <target> -X
cancel' \; paste-buffer -d -p -r -b nt -t <target> \; send-keys -t <target> Enter` (`-r` keeps
`\n` as `\n` instead of tmux's default `\n`→`\r` rewrite; see `tmux-naming.ts`).

Two hazards that come with it, both measured:
- **Copy mode silently unframes.** With `#{pane_in_mode}` = 1, `paste-buffer -p` delivers unframed
  (tmux checks the copy-mode screen, not the app), so a user who scrolled the wheel up gets the
  one-turn-per-line bug. The `if-shell` guard above runs `send-keys -X cancel` first — only when the
  pane is in copy mode — in the same invocation, restoring it.
- **`set-buffer -- "$text"` hits ARG_MAX** around 200 KB. Use `load-buffer -` over stdin — and on
  the SSH path that means piping into the remote command rather than putting the text in argv.

There is no longer a probe or a fallback to weigh: `sendText` delivers through `paste-buffer -p`
**unconditionally** (the plan builders live in `tmux-naming.ts`). The old two-step path — probe
`#{bracket_paste_flag}`, and on a false answer deliver `line1\nline2\nline3\r`, raw newlines into
the app that *mangled* every multi-line write on a pre-3.7 tmux — is gone with the probe.

### Seeding a fresh xterm (`attachReplay` / `seedPaint` in `terminal/terminal-config.ts`)

A newly mounted xterm is empty. Since tmux paints its own client, there is usually **nothing to
seed** — the cases are:
- **`none`** — the terminal was **parked** (its buffer is still live and correct), or it is a
  brand-new node with an `initialCommand`. Seeding either would duplicate content.
- **`cold-snapshot`** (`fresh` — reboot/first open) — the tmux session is genuinely gone, so replay
  the persisted `scrollback-store` snapshot, with a "session restored" separator.
- **`warm-attach`** (`!fresh` — app restart, tmux still alive) — **seed nothing.** tmux is attached
  to this client: it redraws the visible screen and owns the history under the wheel. This is where
  a `warm-history` hydration (`transport.captureHistory` → `tmux capture-pane`) used to run; it was
  **removed**, because writing into a buffer that tmux then repaints is what produced the black
  bands and duplicated screens. The single exception is a **co-attach joiner** (`seedPaint` →
  `create-screen`): tmux only repaints on SIGWINCH, so a joiner that did not resize never gets a
  redraw, and the screen captured server-side inside `create()` (`PtyCreateResult.screen`) is the
  only thing that paints it — see docs/team-presence.md. **A co-attach joiner also misses tmux's
  MOUSE-TRACKING modes** (`?1000h/?1002h/?1006h`): tmux emits them only at its OWN attach, and
  neither the `screen` capture (`capture-pane` carries no private modes) nor a SIGWINCH redraw
  re-sends them — so the joiner's wheel can't scroll tmux history until a keystroke makes the app
  re-request mouse. `join()` therefore sets `PtyCreateResult.coAttachMouse` for tmux-backed joins
  (gated on `persistKey`, on BOTH the screen and resize branches) and the renderer writes
  `CO_ATTACH_MOUSE_SEQ` into the fresh xterm (both `ModalTerminal` and `TerminalNode`). tmux is
  always `mouse on`, so this matches its invariant client state; the enable is idempotent. Was the
  "can't scroll the kanban card-modal terminal until you press a key" bug.

xterm's own `scrollback` (`xtermScrollback(settings.tmuxScrollback)`, floored at 1000, capped at
`XTERM_SCROLLBACK_MAX` = 10000) is kept for the sessions tmux does *not* back (a plain shell when
tmux is unavailable) and for the cold-snapshot replay — it is not what the user scrolls in a tmux
session.

## Session host client: a failed write is an UNDELIVERED frame, not a failed request

`src/core/session-host-client.ts` sends each request one real event-loop turn late so a peer hangup
that has already reached this process is seen (socket destroyed) while the frame is still unwritten
— such a frame is rejected as resendable and `request()` replays it on a fresh connection. **That
recheck is not enough on macOS**: once the host has closed its end of the unix socket, the very next
write fails with `EPIPE` one poll iteration BEFORE Node reads the EOF and marks the socket
destroyed, so the frame goes out on a socket that still reports `destroyed === false`. Linux usually
reads the EOF first, which is why this only ever surfaced there as a Mac-only test failure. A write
that fails at the syscall is therefore classified (`isUndeliveredWriteFailure`) and put back into the
undelivered class — but ONLY when the frame was written alone (`socket.writableLength === 0` and not
corked at write time): `encodeFrame` puts the terminating `\n` last and the host dispatches whole lines
only, so a refused or short solo write delivered nothing the host can act on and resending cannot
double-apply. A chunk queued behind an in-flight write is flushed by Node together with its
neighbours as ONE writev, and a failed writev hands the error to every chunk in it, delivered or not
— reclassifying those would replay a `sendKeys` the pane already typed (found by the 2026-09-02
security side-pass; measured on Node 26 over a unix socket). Do **not** widen this to every
write-callback error: `ECANCELED` (libuv cancelling an in-flight write when the socket is
destroyed) and read-side failures surfacing through a write callback may cover bytes the host already
received and acted upon, so they stay uncertainty and reject the caller.

## Terminal node lifecycle (gotchas)

`src/renderer/nodes/TerminalNode.tsx` is the trickiest file:

- The xterm instance + PTY session are created once in a `useEffect(…, [data.respawnNonce,
  offscreenEpoch])` and torn down on unmount. The component persists across re-renders because
  React Flow keys nodes by `id` — never change a node's id, or you'll respawn its terminal.
  **Third in-place state — "released" (2026-08-11, offscreen dispose):** a node fully offscreen
  in the canvas viewport for `settings.offscreenTerminalMinutes` (default 10, `0` = never;
  Settings → tmux) has its xterm + PTY client torn down IN PLACE — node stays mounted showing a
  plate, tmux session untouched — and revives (warm reattach) when it re-approaches the viewport.
  Pure policy: `terminal/offscreen-policy.ts`. Two load-bearing rules a refactor must not undo:
  (1) the **visibility IntersectionObserver lives in its own mount-stable `[termKey]` effect**,
  NOT the lifecycle effect — the down transition re-runs the lifecycle effect, and an observer
  owned there dies with it, making revive unreachable (permanent plate; caught in review). The
  lifecycle run publishes to it through refs (`visibilityReportRef`, `offscreenLiveRef`,
  identity-checked on clear). (2) The remote exclusion asks `offscreenCoreIsRemote(session.source)`
  (`'local'` only is eligible — relay/server tabs excluded), NOT `data.remote`, **a field nothing
  sets on node data** (a gate on it was constant false and type-invisible; pinned by tests).
  SSH-project nodes are also excluded; collapsed = hidden (same convention as the WebGL budget);
  a `respawnNonce` bump while released revives first. Agent-status/fan-out clears live in a
  dedicated unmount-only effect (a release or respawn must not blank a live badge).
- **React StrictMode is deliberately not used** (`main.tsx`) — double-mount would spawn
  two PTYs per node.
- The xterm container is `nodrag nowheel`; a transparent **hover-guard** overlay sits on top
  until you dwell `settings.panHoverDelay` (so quick drag = move node, scroll = pan). After
  the dwell the guard is removed and xterm takes input. The header stays draggable.
- A `ResizeObserver` drives `FitAddon.fit()` + `transport.resize`. Canvas zoom is a CSS
  transform, so it does *not* change `clientWidth` — cols/rows stay stable across zoom.
  `scale-fix.ts` patches xterm's mouse coords so text selection stays aligned when zoomed.
