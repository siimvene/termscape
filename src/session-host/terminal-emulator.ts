// @xterm/addon-serialize's published types are written against @xterm/xterm's (browser) Terminal,
// which has a superset of DOM-specific members @xterm/headless's Terminal lacks. The addon only
// ever touches buffer/modes/cols/rows at runtime — all present on the headless Terminal — so this
// is a real type mismatch between two packages that are runtime-compatible, not a runtime risk.

/**
 * One session's server-side screen. This is the piece that makes the session host able to
 * reconstruct a fresh client's screen on attach WITHOUT itself being a "painter" the way a real
 * tmux client is — see docs/windows-session-host.md ("The seeding trap") before touching any of
 * this, and CLAUDE.md's "Seeding a fresh xterm" section for why a tmux-shaped answer here
 * (seed nothing on warm attach) would ship a blank terminal or duplicated screens depending on
 * which half you got wrong.
 *
 * MODE RESTORATION, VERIFIED NOT ASSUMED: xterm.js's own `SerializeAddon` already restores most
 * DEC private modes as part of its `serialize()` output (bracketed paste, application cursor
 * keys, origin mode, insert mode, reverse-wraparound, send-focus, wraparound, and — when the
 * active buffer is the alternate screen — the `?1049h` switch). Read directly from the compiled
 * `_serializeModes()` in `node_modules/@xterm/addon-serialize/lib/addon-serialize.js` rather than
 * assumed from the docs. It does NOT emit `CSI ?1006h` (SGR extended mouse coordinates) — there
 * is no separate field on the public `IModes` API for it to read; `modes.mouseTrackingMode` only
 * says which tracking PROTOCOL is on (x10/vt200/drag/any), not the coordinate ENCODING. This app
 * always turns mouse tracking on together with SGR (`CO_ATTACH_MOUSE_SEQ` in the renderer mirrors
 * real tmux's `mouse on`, which always pairs `?1000h`/`?1002h` with `?1006h`), so that one
 * sequence is appended by hand below whenever tracking is active. If a future xterm.js version
 * starts emitting it itself, appending it twice is a harmless idempotent DECSET, not a bug.
