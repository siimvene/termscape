// buildRelayApi — assemble a full `NodeTerminalApi` for a remote-desktop (relay) project tab.
//
// A relay tab is a client of ANOTHER desktop's core, exactly as the browser is a client of the
// Server Edition's core (docs/remote-sessions.md, Stage 4). So it reuses the SAME ws-bridge builders
// the browser uses (`buildRealApi`/`buildFilesApi`/`buildAgentApi`/`buildCanvasApi`/`buildPresenceApi`/
// `buildClaudeApi`) — but over the E2EE relay tunnel (`RelayFrameTransport`) instead of a WebSocket.
// This is the 4a "swap the API object" payoff: a remote tab's `useSession().api` is this object, and
// `createSession('relay', api, label)` (Task 6) wires it into the session registry.
//
// ── The API split (binding, from docs/remote-sessions.md line 70–76) ──────────────────────────────
// • CORE-BOUND namespaces (`pty`, `workspace`, `fs`, `git`, `files`, `context`, `canvas`, `presence`,
//   the `onAgentStatus`/`onSubagentActivity` streams, `claude.cliCaps`, `userDataDir`) route over the
//   relay RpcClient → they hit the REMOTE core. This is what makes the tab actually remote: its
//   terminals, repos, files, canvas and presence all live on the host's machine.
// • APP-GLOBAL namespaces (`updates`, `license`, `clipboard`, `shell`, `dialog`, `media`,
//   `settings`, `pairing`, `announcements`, `usage`, `ssh*`, `remote*`, `relay*`, notifications, menu events)
//   stay LOCAL (`window.nodeTerminal.*`). Your update banner shows YOUR version, a file picker
//   browses YOUR disk, your UI settings/theme are yours, and the relay-tunnel machinery itself is
//   your local main process. Routing one of these to the remote core would be a latent bug.
//
// ── Two gotchas that make or break the tab ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// 1. `pty.onData` is the ONE core-bound member that does NOT go through the RpcClient. Relay pty
//    output is decoded in the main process and re-emitted on a NAMESPACED local `pty:data` channel
//    (`src/main/index.ts` `onPtyData` → `IPC.ptyData(relayPtyDataKey(connectionId, sessionId))` →
//    preload — never the bare host id, which a local pty shares), NOT over the
//    RpcClient frame stream (`RelayFrameTransport.onMessage` only carries JSON frames). So it
//    delegates to the LOCAL preload's `pty.onData` — the same preload member a local pty uses, on the namespaced key. Wire
//    it to the RpcClient instead and the remote terminal is blank.
// 2. `RelayFrameTransport.ready()` resolves on `onApproved`, which fires exactly ONCE. The transport
//    must be constructed (registering that listener) BEFORE the humans confirm the SAS — i.e. Task 6
//    calls `buildRelayApi` while the approval dialog is still open, THEN awaits `ready()`. Building
//    it after approval already fired leaves `ready()` pending forever and the api never comes up.
