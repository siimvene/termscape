// Graceful non-terminal stub surface for the browser (Server Edition) build.
//
// The real namespaces (`pty`, `workspace`, `settings`, `speech`, the fs/git/files/context group
// from `buildFilesApi`, and `dialog` from the in-app `dialog-picker`) are provided by the
// ws-bridge; everything else here degrades benignly so the renderer boots without a full
// Electron preload.
// The exact per-member behavior is the boot-path contract encoded in the Task 7 brief (derived
// from a full renderer-boot audit): every `on*` subscription MUST return a callable no-op
// unsubscribe (the renderer uses the return value as a React effect cleanup — a missing member or
// a non-function return is a mount crash), promise members that the boot path awaits resolve to a
// benign value, and everything else rejects with a coded error.
//
// The object is `satisfies Omit<NodeTerminalApi, 'pty' | 'workspace' | 'settings' | 'fs' | 'git'
// | 'files' | 'context' | 'boardLog' | 'logs' | 'dialog'>`, so the TypeScript compiler is the completeness test: if
// `NodeTerminalApi` gains a member, this file fails to typecheck until the stub is declared.
