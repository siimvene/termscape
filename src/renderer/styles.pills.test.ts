/**
 * Guard on the bottom-left pill cluster's SHARED shell.
 *
 * Written after a real regression: the system-resource pill was collapsed to an icon by editing
 * what looked like a `.sysres-pill` rule — but the selector was `.usage-pill, .sysres-pill`, so the
 * `width: 26px; padding: 0` landed on the Claude usage pill too and squashed it into a circle. The
 * two pills sit side by side and share a shell deliberately; the failure mode is that a change
 * aimed at one silently reshapes the other, and nothing rendered in CI would have caught it.
 *
 * The rule this pins: the shared block carries only what BOTH pills want. Per-pill sizing lives in
 * a rule whose selector names exactly one pill.

// `.replace(/\r\n/g, '\n')` on every read below: a test that reads a checked-in file must not
// care how git checked it out. Git for Windows defaults to `core.autocrlf=true`, so a Windows
// clone has CRLF working files, and a slice on a literal containing `\n` (`indexOf('}\n}')`,
// `indexOf('\n}\n')`) then matches nothing and the assertion fails on a checkout with zero local
// changes (issue #578). `.gitattributes` is the durable half of the fix; this is the half that
// survives a working tree that was checked out before it landed.
