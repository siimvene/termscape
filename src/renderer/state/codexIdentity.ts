/**
 * The renderer's half of the Codex shared-identity fallback.
 *
 * TWO questions, and they are not the same one:
 *
 *  1. "Should this launch line name the managed launcher?" — answered BEFORE the node exists, by
 *     `codexSharedIdentity(ssh)` below. Same shape as the `--permission-mode auto` gate: a
 *     memoized shell probe whose unknown answer is the conservative one, so an unprobed or failed
 *     machine emits the bare `codex` it always did rather than a launcher path that may not
 *     resolve. That is the difference between "no shared identity" and "a dead node".
 *
 *  2. "What did this node ACTUALLY get?" — answered AFTER it launched, by the node's own launcher
 *     (`codex-identity:event`). Only the launcher can see the pane's env, whether the endpoint
 *     file was readable, or whether the installed `codex` even has an app-server, so the script
 *     is the authority and question 1 is only an optimistic gate in front of it.
 *
 * The mode is TRANSIENT — never persisted. It describes one launch of one process; a node reloaded
 * from disk has not launched anything yet, and a stale "plain" badge on it would be a lie.
