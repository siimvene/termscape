   *   Everything beside it is a placeholder: the zeros are NOT a device count and the null key is
   *   not "no key". Render the failure, never the numbers.
   * - **The read was fine; the RELEASE was refused** — `too_soon` (with `retryAfterDays`) |
   *   `not_applicable`. These ride on top of the last good read (see `releaseOthers`), so `key`,
   *   `source` and the counts are real and worth showing — say the action was refused, not that
   *   the license could not be read. (The counts are the last good read's; if nothing was ever
   *   read successfully they are still EMPTY_DETAIL's zeros, so call `loadDetail` first.)
   *
   * A release that failed for any OTHER reason never lands here — `releaseOthers` hands that code
   * back to its caller instead. It said nothing about the license, and merging it made the panel
   * replace a real key and real counts with "could not read this license", while saying nothing
   * about the action the user had just pressed.
