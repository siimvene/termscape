 * The launch-command override for an agent, or undefined when nothing overrides the bare CLI.
 * This is the ONE place launch commands are read; every launch site (new node, cold restore,
 * in-place restart, hibernation wake, transcript resume) either calls this or receives its result
 * — shared/agents/config.ts cannot read settings (layering), so the renderer resolves the override
 * and passes it down (`resumeCommand`'s `base` param).
 *
 * Three layers, most specific first, with `projectId` naming the project that OWNS the node:
 *  1. the project's LOCAL `.nodeterm/settings.json` `agents.launchCmd` — this machine's own file,
 *     the user's own typing, never gated;
 *  2. the project's git-SHARED `agents.launchCmd`, but ONLY while that family is trusted at this
 *     location. Falling PAST an untrusted one raises the trust prompt (once per project, see
 *     `askAgentsTrustOnce`) and resolves on the layer below meanwhile — a launch is never blocked,
 *     never delayed, and never runs a shared command the human has not seen;
 *  3. the user's global Settings → Agents → Launch commands entry (builtin-keyed: custom agents
 *     index past it to undefined — they already own their launchCmd).
 *
 * SCOPE: the project's launchCmd applies ONLY to the agent that project ITSELF names —
 * `projectDefaultAgent`, its own valid `agents.defaultAgentId`, never the global default. The
 * family holds one launchCmd, not one per agent id, and the panel's copy is "Overrides how the
 * default agent is launched", so it needs an agent to be about; the pair is what makes it
 * meaningful. Falling back to the GLOBAL default here would have been a cross-agent misfire that
 * the builtin-KEYED global map made structurally impossible: a doc shipping only `launchCmd` would
 * follow whatever this user's mutable global default happens to be, so `nix develop -c claude`
 * could end up typed into a codex node, differently on each teammate's machine, and could change
 * under a node on cold restore after an unrelated Settings change.
 *
 * So an UNPAIRED launchCmd (a project that sets no valid `defaultAgentId` of its own) is a dead
 * setting: never consumed for any agent, and never prompts for trust. The Agents panel says so
 * on the row itself (`ProjectSettingsFamilies.tsx`) rather than leaving it silently inert.
 *
 * Fails OPEN in the ordinary sense: no project id, or no warm snapshot for it
 * (`projectLaunchInfoNow` is synchronous by design — see its module doc), resolves layer 3 alone,
 * byte-identical to the behavior before per-project settings existed.

/**
 * Apply ONE peer mutation (canvas sync) to the LIVE React Flow node array — patch/append/remove
 * just that node, and leave every other node object untouched.
 *
 * NOT `nodeStatesToFlow(applyCanvasMutation(flowToNodeStates(nodes), m))`. That whole-canvas round
 * trip was the first cut, and the serializers are lossy BY DESIGN, so it destroyed live state on
 * every peer mutation — 20 times a second while a teammate drags:
 *   - SELECTION. `nodeStatesToFlow` never sets `selected`, so a teammate's drag wiped your
 *     box-select / shift-click / select-then-group the instant it landed.
 *   - LOCAL-ONLY DATA. `initialCommand`, `respawnNonce` never survive a serialize.
 *   - IDENTITY. Every node object was rebuilt → every node component re-rendered, per mutation.
 * Patching in place keeps all four: untouched nodes keep their object identity (React.memo holds),
 * and the touched one keeps `selected` and its local-only data.
 *
 * `measured` is deliberately NOT carried over on the patched node: React Flow's measured size wins
 * over `width`/`height` in flowToNodeStates, so keeping a stale one would make us serialize the OLD
 * size after a peer resized the node — and re-publish it, fighting the peer. Dropping it lets React
 * Flow re-measure from the incoming `style`, which is what the peer sent.
