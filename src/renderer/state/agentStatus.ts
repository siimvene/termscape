/**
 * Transient per-node status for agent (e.g. Claude Code) sessions, driven by the agent's hooks.
 * `unread`, `session`, `sessionId`, `agentId`, `loop` and `hibernated` are persisted to
 * localStorage so they survive a reload/restart; the live `state` (working/waiting/…) is not
 * (it'd be stale on relaunch), and neither are its two clocks (`stateAt`, `lastEventAt`).
 * `agentId` is durable because a PLAIN terminal's agent identity exists nowhere else: an
 * explicit agent node re-derives it from `data.agentId`, but a hand-launched `claude` in a
 * plain terminal is only known here, and its context links must keep classifying across
 * restarts (tmux keeps the session — and the agent — alive through them).
 *
 * ONE STORE PER CORE (stage 4): `createAgentStatusSession(persistKey?)` builds an isolated
 * instance — node ids are per-core, so status tables from two cores must never mix. The module
 * keeps a DEFAULT instance for the local core and re-exports its members under the historical
 * names, so the existing single-session consumers are untouched. The session registry resolves
 * a store through `agentStatusForApi(api)` — memoized BY API IDENTITY like presence, and seeded
 * with `window.nodeTerminal → defaultAgentStatus`, so the local session (and any path handed a
 * repeat api) structurally gets the one existing store, never a parallel twin.
 *
 * PERSISTENCE IS PER-KEY, AND ONLY THE DEFAULT HAS ONE. This is deliberately the opposite call
 * from presence's shared ME_KEY: {name, color} is who the HUMAN is (one per person, shared
 * across sessions), but agent status is per-NODE state on a SPECIFIC core — a remote core's
 * unread/sessionId for `nt-x` is not this machine's `nt-x` (tmux persistKeys are unique within
 * one core only), and `save()` rewrites the WHOLE table, so a remote session sharing
 * `nodeterm.agentStatus` would clobber the local nodes' persisted unread/session/loop on its
 * first write. So: the default instance keeps the historical key (bit-for-bit today's
 * behavior, legacy migration included); a keyless instance persists NOTHING (remote status is
 * rebuilt from the remote core's hooks on reconnect — a durable per-remote key needs a stable
 * session identity, which sub-stage 4c owns); the `persistKey` parameter is how 4c opts a
 * session into its own namespaced key without touching this file.
