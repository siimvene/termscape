// S6 PR 8 — reconcile pending Codex accounts against the app-servers' live identity, without
// trusting attacker-controlled settings fields. Based on @Corvin's #112
// (`src/renderer/state/codexAccountReconcile.ts`).
//
// `discover` reads only the identity the account home actually holds (an authenticated `auth.json`
// yielded an email); `apply` merges that against a FRESH accounts list so a login that resolves
// late can never revive an account the user removed, nor clobber one that already changed. Nothing
// here fabricates an account: an unauthenticated / unreadable home drops out of the resolved set.
