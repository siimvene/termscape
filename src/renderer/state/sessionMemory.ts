// Session-memory store. Two cadences, because the two reads cost wildly different things:
//   - `refreshHost` is one file read locally → safe to poll (the pill's number).
//   - `refreshFull` walks the whole process table, and over SSH it is an exec on someone else's
//     machine → on demand only (panel open, refresh button). Never on a timer.
//
// Scope changes are guarded the way state/worktrees.ts guards project switches, except the stamp
// here is the SCOPE ITSELF rather than a counter: a response stamped with a scope we have since
// left is DISCARDED, so an SSH host's rows (or its RAM number) can never land under the local
// machine's label. A counter alone is not enough — `refreshFull` and `startHostPoll` can be called
// for different scopes without any intervening bump, which is exactly the switch this must catch.
