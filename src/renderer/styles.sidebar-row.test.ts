/**
 * The sessions-sidebar row gives its NAME priority over the chips beside it.
 *
 * MEASURED in a real browser against these rules (headless Chrome, the 300px sidebar, a row
 * carrying a session chip and the account chip): the title was **45px** — four or five characters
 * — against 128px for the same row without the account chip, and a row with long values overflowed
 * its own line by 44px with the title at **0**. The cause was not one number: `.ss-title` was the
 * only shrinkable thing in the line, because `.ss-chip` was `flex: 0 0 auto` and the shared
 * `.node-account-chip` (built for the node header, where there is room) carries `flex-shrink: 0`
 * and a 120px cap.
 *
 * Every rule below is one of the three halves of the fix, and each is invisible in review: a
 * `flex` shorthand quietly re-setting `flex-shrink` back to 0, or the sidebar's class going
 * missing from `SessionRow`, restores the bug with nothing on screen to say so.
 *
 * `\r\n` is normalized for the same reason every other file-reading test here does it (see the
 * line-endings rule in CLAUDE.md): a Windows checkout would otherwise fail these on whitespace.
