/**
 * Drawing a node's icon. One component, used by every surface that lists a node — the canvas
 * header, the kanban card, the card modal and the sessions sidebar — so an icon cannot look like
 * four different things depending on where you happen to be looking at the session.
 *
 * Renders NOTHING (not a placeholder, not an empty box) when the node has no icon, when the icon
 * is an image that is still loading, and when that image could not be read. All three are the same
 * thing from the user's side: the node looks exactly as it did before the feature. An icon is
 * decoration — it must never occupy space it cannot fill, and it must never announce its own
 * failure in a header that is already carrying six chips.
