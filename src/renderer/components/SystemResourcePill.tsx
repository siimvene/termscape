 *
 * Clicking toggles the session-memory panel; this pill is the panel's only entry point. The panel
 * is UNMOUNTED while closed — its sweep is expensive (the whole process table, and over SSH an
 * exec on someone else's machine) and must never run behind a closed panel. Mounting is what
 * triggers the sweep, which is also why the pill itself never calls `refreshFull`.
