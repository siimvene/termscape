// The panel behind the system-resource pill: which sessions are holding the machine's memory,
// biggest first, each one travelable and killable.
//
// Three rules run through the whole file, and each of them is a fact this feature exists to stop
// the app from getting wrong:
//   1. "We could not look" and "there is nothing" are DIFFERENT ANSWERS. A failed sweep says so —
//      it never degrades into an empty list, a `0 MB` total or a "0 sessions" count.
//   2. Orphan-ness comes from the resolved row, never from a missing agent state: a plain terminal
//      never enters the agent-status map at all.
//   3. Every row is rendered. A cap would have to announce itself.
