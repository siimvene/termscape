/**
 * Choosing a node's icon: an emoji from a small palette, any character typed by hand, or an image
 * file from disk.
 *
 * Driven by the promise-based singleton `nodeIconDialog()` — the same shape as `promptDialog()` —
 * so every surface that can set an icon (the node context menu, the node header, the kanban card
 * modal) opens the SAME dialog and none of them has to own its state.
 *
 * The three outcomes are distinct on purpose, and the caller must keep them distinct:
 *   `NodeIcon` → set this icon.  `null` → remove the icon.  `undefined` → cancelled, change nothing.
 * Collapsing "remove" into "cancel" is how a Remove button silently does nothing.
 *
 * **Where an image goes.** Not where the user picked it from: a path outside the project would
 * break for everyone who clones the repo, and would break here the moment the file moves. The
 * bytes are copied through `files.saveCanvasImage`, the same seam canvas image nodes use, which
 * puts them in the project's git-shared `.nodeterm/images/` (or a durable app-local folder when
 * the project has no local cwd). The stored path is then made `./`-relative by `portableIconPath`
 * so the icon travels with the canvas that names it.
 *
 * **Relay tabs are refused**, with the same message and for the same reason canvas image import
 * is: the write is this machine's preload while the read is the peer's core, so the node would end
 * up naming a file only this machine has. A clear refusal beats an icon that can never draw.
