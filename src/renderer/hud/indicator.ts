// Pure aggregation + ordering for the collapsed Notch HUD indicator (docs/notch-hud.md).
//
// `buildIndicator` is the ONE definition of what the collapsed capsule shows, derived from the same
// row array the expanded panel draws. It lives here rather than beside the main-process HUD model
// because the renderer is the only side that draws it, and a renderer must never import src/main
// (process-model boundary) — a copy over there could only ever be dead code that drifts, which is
// exactly what happened: it never grew the `needsYou` dot this renderer has been drawing.
//
// The ordering below: the indicator hugs the LEFT edge of the notch and reads right→left. agent-notch draws Claude
// rightmost (nearest the notch) and Codex to its left (main.swift IndicatorView.draw: claude is
// drawn first at bounds.maxX, then codex to the left). Our indicator is a normal left→right flex
// row, so the LAST element is the rightmost/notch-side one. This helper returns the working agent
// ids in left→right paint order (Claude last) so the DOM matches agent-notch's slot order.
//
// Kept pure + Electron-free so both are unit-tested without a DOM.

 *   ~170 px black bar with the mascots huddled at one end [screenshot-measured 2026-09-02 on a 16"
