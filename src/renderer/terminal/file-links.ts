// Cmd/Ctrl+click links in terminal output. `createUrlLinkProvider` handles http(s) URLs;
// `createFileLinkProvider` handles path-like tokens — what counts as one (separator paths with
// Unicode, bracketed and spaced segments, bare filenames, `file://` URIs, `:line[:col]` suffixes,
// home-relative `~/x`) is file-link-tokens.ts. A `~` path stays
// `~`-rooted all the way to the filesystem call: the core that owns the filesystem expands it
// against ITS home (`expandHomePath` in core/fs-handlers.ts; an SSH project's remote shell does it
// for `sshFs`) — the renderer does not know that home, and on the Server Edition it is another
// machine's.
//
// Existence (and dir-ness) is verified before a file link is offered, via a short-TTL cache
// of parent-directory listings — one fs.list covers every sibling on a compiler-error screen.
//
// Long tokens span rows two different ways, and BOTH are joined into one logical paragraph
// (`paragraphContaining`) before matching:
//   - SOFT wrap — xterm wrapped a long streamed line itself; the continuation row carries
//     `isWrapped`. The easy, always-joined case.
//   - HARD wrap — tmux repaints (attach, resize, refresh) and an agent's fullscreen TUI PAINT
//     the screen row by row with explicit cursor moves, so a long line lands as separate
//     full-width rows with NO wrapped flags. This is what a `claude /login` OAuth URL looks
//     like in practice; matching per-row opened just the clicked row's fragment (a truncated,
//     wrong URL). A row is treated as continuing onto the next when it is full to the LAST
//     column and the next row starts at column 0 with a non-space — a heuristic (the buffer
//     genuinely cannot distinguish a repainted wrap from prose that exactly fills the row),
//     gated tightly and capped at MAX_JOIN_ROWS, and the regex still has to match across the
//     seam for a link to result.
// A third kind — an agent TUI wrapping its own prose under a hanging indent — is NOT joined into
// the paragraph: it is offered as extra readings that existence decides (`hangingReadings`).

 * Right-click on a link → the host's link menu (open / reveal / download / copy — see
 * link-menu.ts). A right-click anywhere else is left EXACTLY as it was: tmux's own pane menu in a
 * plain shell (tmux 3.x binds MouseDown3Pane to `display-menu` unless the app took the mouse), the
 * press forwarded to an agent TUI that did, and the node's context menu bubbling up to React Flow.
 *
 * The decision is made on the PRESS, because that is what reaches tmux: xterm reports a
 * right-button press as a mouse escape, and once it is sent tmux has already opened its menu. So
 * the capture-phase `mousedown` hit-tests, and on a link swallows the press, its release and the
 * `contextmenu` that follows (that one is also what would open the node menu and xterm's own
 * right-click handling). The menu opens on `contextmenu`, the event every platform fires for the
 * gesture — after the press on macOS/Linux, after the release on Windows. A `contextmenu` with no
 * right press on a link before it (Shift+F10, the Menu key) is not ours. Unlike the Cmd+click
 * fallback this runs whatever the mouse-tracking mode: with reporting off there is no tmux to
 * protect, but the node menu and xterm's own right-click still must not open over ours.
