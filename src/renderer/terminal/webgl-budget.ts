/**
 * Module-level WebGL context BUDGET coordinator.
 *
 * Chromium caps live WebGL contexts per process at ~16. When a page tries to exceed that cap the
 * browser force-EVICTS an existing context to make room — and that victim is sometimes a context
 * belonging to a terminal the user is currently looking at, which then paints as Chromium's
 * "lost context" dead-canvas placeholder (a white box with a sad-face icon) until our own
 * `onContextLoss` → dispose → DOM-fallback lands a beat later.
 *
 * The per-node IntersectionObserver decisions (acquire when visible, release after a delay when
 * hidden) are each individually correct but globally UN-coordinated: a fast pan across a
 * 30-terminal canvas, or zooming out past ~16 visible terminals, momentarily OVERSHOOTS the cap —
 * nodes panned away from keep their context for the release delay while newly visible nodes each
 * acquire immediately — so the browser force-evicts, and the dead placeholder flashes.
 *
 * This coordinator keeps the number of contexts WE hold at or under `WEBGL_BUDGET`, which sits
 * comfortably below the browser cap. If we never exceed it ourselves, the browser never has to
 * force-evict anyone, so the dead placeholder cannot appear. The coordinator owns ALL timing and
 * the grant decision; the per-node `acquire`/`release` callbacks stay dumb and idempotent.
 *
 * Grant rules:
 *  - A client that becomes visible is granted only after a short ACQUIRE DEBOUNCE
 *    (`WEBGL_ACQUIRE_DEBOUNCE_MS`), so a fast pan sweeping a node across the viewport for a couple
 *    of frames never acquires. (`rootMargin` on the observer already pre-announces approach.)
 *  - If granting would exceed the budget, the coordinator immediately RECLAIMS from the
 *    least-recently-visible HIDDEN holder. If every holder is currently visible, the newcomer
 *    is NOT granted and stays on the DOM renderer. Either way we never push past the budget,
 *    so the browser never force-evicts.
 *  - A client that becomes hidden KEEPS its context — warm for a pan-back of any length, so
 *    re-entering the viewport costs no renderer swap. Reclaim is strictly ON DEMAND: the LRU
 *    hidden holder gives its slot to a visible newcomer when the budget is full, and
 *    `releaseAllHiddenGrants` gives every hidden context back under memory pressure. (A
 *    proactive time-based release used to exist; it bought nothing those two levers don't,
 *    and its DOM→WebGL re-upgrade was a visible rendering flicker on every pan-back. Same
 *    story for the old zoom-out suspend gate: measured A/B under load, the gate COST
 *    main-thread time — half-second swap-wave stalls at its band plus 2.4× the work for
 *    streaming terminals forced onto the DOM renderer at far zoom — while the budget already
 *    bounds the context count at any zoom.)
 *  - `acquire()` returning false (WebGL2 unavailable / threw) does not count against the budget.
 *  - A context lost from outside (the addon's own `onContextLoss`) is reported via
 *    `handle.contextLost()`: the grant is dropped from the accounting, and for a STILL-VISIBLE
 *    client ONE budget-gated re-grant attempt is scheduled (`WEBGL_REACQUIRE_AFTER_LOSS_MS`).
 *    Sleep/wake GPU resets lose EVERY context at once while nothing changes visibility — without
 *    the re-grant, a woken machine's terminals sat on the DOM renderer indefinitely (the
 *    "fallback feel": different cursor/scroll rendering) until the user happened to pan them out
 *    and back. This is NOT the per-node self-re-acquire loop the old "never re-grant" rule
 *    feared: the attempt goes through `tryGrant`, which never exceeds the budget and never
 *    reclaims a visible holder, so re-granting clients cannot evict each other; and repeated
 *    losses (`WEBGL_LOSS_STREAK_MAX`) stop the attempts until the next visibility transition —
 *    a genuinely unstable GPU degrades to the DOM renderer exactly as before.

 * THE CRISP GATE — above this canvas zoom no terminal ON SCREEN holds a context: each one paints
 * through xterm's DOM renderer instead. Hidden holders keep their warm contexts through the gate
 * (the blur only matters where it can be seen), and one that comes into view while the gate is
 * closed gives its context back at rest (see `setVisible`).
 *
 * A GPU terminal is a BITMAP: the addon rasterizes into a canvas sized from the element's LAYOUT
 * box in device pixels, and React Flow's `transform: scale()` then magnifies that bitmap. xterm
 * never learns about the zoom — its sizing observer reads `devicePixelContentBoxSize`, which
 * ignores transforms — so zooming in makes GPU text softer and dimmer, while the DOM renderer's
 * text is re-rastered by the browser at the composited scale and gets SHARPER. Measured on one
 * node with identical content (share of ink pixels sitting mid-ramp between background and peak;
 * higher = blurrier):
 *
 *              100%     200%    peak glyph luminance at 200%
 *   webgl      55.7% →  62.7%   226 → 194
 *   dom        60.3% →  36.8%   226 → 226
 *
 * Raising the terminal's effective device-pixel ratio with the zoom was tried first and does not
 * work from outside the addon: three variants (dpr override; + pinning the backing store; +
 * re-running the renderer resize) all left the terminal drawing almost nothing, because the
 * renderer assumes throughout that its canvas is at true device resolution. Swapping renderers is
 * what remains, and it is affordable because only what is on screen swaps: at this zoom that is
 * one or two terminals, not a canvas-wide rebalance.
 *
 * This is deliberately the INVERSE of the zoom gate removed in the budget-only lifecycle change,
 * and it is not that gate returning: that one suspended the GPU when zoomed OUT past 40% on a
 * compositor theory that was later refuted, and it cost half-second stalls on a band users cross
 * constantly. This one triggers only when someone zooms IN past 175% — a deliberate "let me read
 * this" gesture — and the release it performs is the cheap direction (teardown, no shader compile
 * or atlas build).

 * all the way to 175%; dom 39.7% at 100%, 38.1% at 110%, falling to 26.5% at 200%. At DPR 2 the
 * softening is milder and reads as fine, so a high-DPI display keeps the 175% threshold.
 *
 * On a low-DPI display every zoom-in past 100% therefore swaps the terminals on screen to DOM.
 * That is more terminals than the high-DPI case (at 110% most of a canvas can still be on screen),
 * so it costs DOM rendering where there used to be GPU; that is the trade #361 left open ("moves
 * to ~1.2 and nothing else changes") and the one #986 asks for. 100% itself, and every zoom-out,
 * stay on the GPU.
 *
 * It is also the COMMON path here, not a rare one: `goToNode` frames a node at up to 138%
 * (`FIT_NODE_OPTIONS.maxZoom`), so on a low-DPI display every focus — sidebar, ⌘K, notification,
 * double-click — crosses this line and comes back. That is why the gate leaves hidden holders
 * warm. Releasing the whole pool instead, with 24 holders and the focused node registered last,
 * put that node's release behind 22 off-screen ones (1.1 s after the canvas settled, at
 * `WEBGL_SWAPS_PER_DRAIN` per `WEBGL_DRAIN_MS`) and cost 24 re-grants — shader compile + atlas
