/**
 * Per-terminal font size from the keyboard (issue #915): ⌘+ / ⌘− grow and shrink the FOCUSED
 * terminal's font, ⌘0 puts it back on the global size — what every terminal emulator (iTerm2,
 * Terminal.app, Windows Terminal, VS Code's integrated terminal) means by those keys.
 *
 * **Opt-in** (`settings.terminalFontZoomKeys`, Settings → Terminal, default OFF), and only ever
 * while a terminal has keyboard focus. With it off — or outside a terminal — every key here keeps
 * doing exactly what it did before: ⌘0 zooms the canvas to 100% (`lib/zoomShortcut.ts`), ⌘+ / ⌘−
 * reach whatever has focus. Opt-in rather than default because off-mac the chord is Ctrl+− /
 * Ctrl+=, and Ctrl+− is a real shell key (readline's `undo`, ^_) that a focused terminal passes to
 * the pty today; taking it away from existing users uninvited is the #383 mistake again.
 *
 * **The override lives on the NODE** (`data.terminalFontSize`, persisted in project.json like any
 * other node field) and is layered over the global size in ONE place — `useXtermVisualSettings`'s
 * optional override, via `withTerminalFontSize` below — so the canvas TerminalNode and the kanban
 * card modal's second view of the SAME session read one value through one options path
 * (`applyLiveOptions`) and cannot drift. The settings preview passes no override, so it keeps
 * showing the global size being edited.
 *
 * Font size is CELL GEOMETRY: a change reports `metricsChanged` from `applyLiveOptions`, and both
 * surfaces already route that through their re-fit + pty resize, exactly like a live global
 * font-size edit — so the pty is told the new cols/rows with no new code on that path. Canvas zoom
 * is untouched by all of this: it is a CSS transform over the node, independent of the font.
 *
 * ONE WRITER. Every entry point (the canvas terminal's xterm key handler, the card modal's, and the
 * desktop ⌘0 that main forwards without an event) asks Canvas to apply the step through
 * `requestTerminalFontZoom`, so the read-modify-write of node data, `markDirty` and the clamp all
 * happen in one handler instead of three.
