/**
 * THE FOURTH KILL LEVER (issue #126). Defer this release — indefinitely — while disposing the
 * terminal would destroy work that is still running.
 *
 * This module's whole premise is that a release is cheap: the node stays mounted, the tmux session
 * keeps running, and the revive is a warm re-attach that redraws. Without tmux underneath none of
 * that holds — the pty IS the shell — so releasing an offscreen agent node on a plain-shell setup
 * terminates the CLI mid-turn and the node's restart machinery resumes it from wherever the kill
 * landed. Panning away from a working agent is not a request to stop it.
 *
 * Expressed as a DEFERRAL rather than a refusal because this fire path already has exactly that
 * shape and cadence (`shouldDeferReleaseForEco` → re-arm at `OFFSCREEN_DEFER_RETRY_MS`): every
 * input is re-asked a minute later, so "protected" is a state the node LEAVES on its own the
 * moment its agent goes idle, and the release then proceeds normally. No new timer, no new state,
 * nothing to remember.
 *
 * UNCAPPED, and that is the one place it deliberately differs from the Eco deferral above. That
 * one caps because it waits for a hibernation that may never come, and stranding a viewer forever
 * for an event that cannot happen would be worse than the memory it saves. Here the thing waited
 * for is the user's own session ending, and "give up and release anyway" IS the reported bug — a
 * cap would just be the same kill with a delay in front of it. So no clock is an input at all.
 *
 * BE HONEST ABOUT WHAT THAT COSTS. `working` resolves within `WORKING_STALE_MS` even when the CLI
 * dies without saying so: Canvas's 60-second `sweepStaleWorking` blanks a working entry that has
 * gone that quiet, and this predicate reads that entry. (It works HERE because the node is still
 * MOUNTED, so its store entry is intact — the park path cannot rely on the same sweep, which is
 * why the park's snapshot ages itself out instead; see `live-work.ts`'s `parkedStateFloor`.)
 * `waiting`/`blocked` has no such sweep, and legitimately so: a question held open for the user is
 * not stale, it is waiting for them. A user who never answers therefore holds this node's viewer
 * for as long as the app runs.
 *
 * That is accepted, because the exposure is bounded in the dimension that matters. It is not
 * unbounded growth: it is at most one held viewer (~15 MB) per non-tmux node that is actually
 * sitting on an unanswered prompt — a count the user creates by hand and can see on the canvas,
 * where the badge is telling them the node needs them. Bounded by node count, not by time. The
 * alternative is trading a bounded amount of memory for the user's running work, which is the
 * trade this whole change exists to stop making.

/**
 * PHASE 5 ORDERING: with Eco on, releasing an offscreen terminal's viewer WAITS for its agent to
 * hibernate first.
 *
 * The two features want the same node and they are not equal prizes. This release reclaims the
 * xterm buffer and the PTY client — roughly 15 MB at the top end. Hibernation reclaims the agent
 * CLI PROCESS, which is hundreds of MB. But the release UNWIRES the node (the lifecycle effect
 * tears down, so the hibernate pair is unregistered and `planHibernation` reads the node as
 * unwired), and at the shipped defaults it fires FIRST — 10 minutes offscreen against a 30-minute
 * idle window. The canonical case the whole feature exists for, "finish a turn and pan away",
 * therefore never hibernated at all: the small prize was taken in a way that forfeited the large
 * one. So the release defers, and the ordering becomes hibernate-then-release; once the CLI is
 * gone, the pane holds a plain shell and the viewer release is a pure win on top.
 *
 * The deferral is CAPPED, and the cap is why this cannot strand anything: a node that will never
 * hibernate — a `/cron` node, one with a live subagent, an agent with no session id yet — must not
 * hold its viewer forever waiting for something that is not coming. Past
 * `idleMinutes + offscreenMinutes` the release proceeds regardless, so the worst case is that a
 * non-hibernating node keeps its buffer for the sum of the two windows instead of one of them.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT gated on "this node is currently eligible": eligibility is a moving target
 * (a working node goes done, a session id arrives late), and asking for it here would re-implement
 * `planHibernation` in a second place. The question asked is the durable one — could this node's
 * CLI ever be quit and resumed at all — and the cap covers the rest.
 *
 * ONE exception to that, and it is not a moving target at all: `idleKnown`. The policy's "unknown
 * idle is NOT idle" rule refuses any candidate with no `lastEventAt`, and that clock is TRANSIENT
 * by design — a relaunch has seen no hook events yet. So after every app restart, every warm
 * agent node is one hibernation can provably deliver nothing for until it takes a turn, and
 * deferring for them would hold every viewer for the whole 40-minute cap: Eco switched on would
 * MEAN a memory regression for the first stretch of each session. Waiting is only justified when
 * the thing waited for can actually happen.
