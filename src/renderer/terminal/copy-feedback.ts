// What a terminal says right after a copy — and, once per installation, what to do when a drag
// produced nothing at all.
//
// Measured background (spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-09-terminal-copy-feedback-design.md):
// a codex pane leaves the mouse to tmux, so a drag is a copy-mode selection that `copy-pipe-and-
// cancel` copies via OSC 52 on RELEASE — clearing the highlight at the same instant, which reads
// as "the copy failed". A claude pane captures the mouse, so a plain drag produces nothing at all
// and only ⌥/Shift (xterm's own selection) works. Neither state had any on-screen evidence.
//
// This module is the decision alone: no DOM, no React, no storage. `useCopyFeedback` is the glue.
