/**
 * The paste chord that xterm's own keymap would EAT — Ctrl+V, and only on Windows.
 *
 * We do not paste ourselves: the platform already does, and identically on every surface. On
 * macOS ⌘V reaches the Edit menu's `{role:'paste'}` (Chromium routes those into the focused
 * element), which dispatches a `paste` event to xterm's helper textarea; xterm's handler applies
 * bracketed-paste framing and writes it to the pty. All this decision does is stop xterm from
 * CANCELLING the keydown, so the same platform path runs on Windows too.
 *
 * Measured against `@xterm/xterm`'s `evaluateKeyboardEvent` (issue #562):
 * - **Ctrl+V** maps to `\x16` (SYN) with `cancel: true`, so xterm calls `preventDefault()` — which
 *   suppresses Chromium's paste editing command AND keeps the Ctrl+V menu accelerator from firing
 *   (an accelerator only runs on a keydown the renderer did not consume). Hence: nothing pasted,
 *   nothing typed, no error. This is the whole bug.
 * - **Ctrl+Shift+V** and **Shift+Insert** produce no key and no cancel, so xterm already lets them
 *   through to the platform. They need no branch here, and adding one would only risk breaking
 *   what works.
 *
 * **Windows only, deliberately.** On macOS ⌘V is the paste chord and Ctrl+V must stay `\x16`; on
 * Linux the terminal convention is Ctrl+Shift+V, and Ctrl+V is a key people actually send (vim's
 * blockwise-visual, readline's literal-next). Windows Terminal's own default is Ctrl+V = paste,
 * so this matches what a Windows user's other terminal does — at the cost of `\x16` there, the
