 * park just means the next remount is a warm tmux reattach (tmux redraws), the same path every
 * remount after the 5-minute window already takes.
 *
 * 20 (raised from 12 in issue #886): with several SSH projects open, 12 was hit long before the
 * park window and turned ordinary project cycling into seconds-long remote reattaches. A parked
 * tmux-backed terminal measured ≈ 2 MB (headless xterm, 200×50), so the raise costs ≈ 16 MB more
 * in the common case; a plain shell with a full scrollback (≈ 27 MB) is the expensive exception,

 * see `parkedStateFloor`, which is why the snapshot ages itself out) but because the floor stops
 * counting there. A `waiting`/`blocked` one is NOT bounded in time at all: it is held until the
 * user answers the question the badge is showing them, possibly for the whole run. Accepted, and
