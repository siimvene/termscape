// Two-act delivery of a node's one-shot launch command (initialCommand / cold-restore
// resume) into a freshly spawned shell. Writing line+Enter blind races shell init: zsh's
// rc/ZLE setup resets the tty with a FLUSH that can eat part of the queued line, and a
// mangled line submitted anyway strands the shell at `quote>` (field report: 3 spawned
// team agents, none started, each needed a manual `'` + Enter). So: write WITHOUT Enter,
// wait until the shell has echoed both ENDS of the line back, THEN submit. A verify timeout
// kills the pending line (Ctrl-U) and rewrites; the LAST attempt submits unverified —
// fail-open, a terminal whose echo we can't recognize must never block the launch (that
// worst case is exactly the pre-fix behavior).
//
// The ONE exception to failing open is a line the tty could not physically have taken: a
// canonical-mode buffer silently drops everything past its cap (1024 bytes on macOS), so an
// over-cap command is truncated mid-quote and Enter would strand the shell at `quote>` with the
// agent never launched (#706). That case is refused, not submitted — see `DeliveryOutcome` and
// @shared/canonical-line.

 *  - `line-too-long` — the echo never verified AND the command is longer than a canonical-mode
 *    tty can carry (`MAX_LAUNCH_LINE_BYTES`), so the pane is holding a KNOWN-truncated line.

 *    dropped strands the shell at `quote>` and the agent never starts (#706). A refusal the
