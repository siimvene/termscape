/**
 * STRUCTURAL pins for the armed-launch delivery loop (issue #569 item 1) — same class of test as
 * `control-open-project.source.test.ts`, and for the same reason: the loop is an effect inside a
 * 9000-line React component with no unit seam. The DECISIONS it makes are proven against real
 * primitives elsewhere (`pendingLaunch.test.ts` for the schedule and the tooltip,
 * `launchDelivery.test.ts` for the record); what only the source can state is which signals the
 * effect consults and what it does when it runs out of them.
 *
 * The bug: delivery was a flat 5 × 400 ms budget started when the CANVAS held the node, spent
 * while its terminal was still being spawned, and abandoned into a `console.warn`. A node opened
 * into a project the user was not looking at therefore said QUEUED forever, and neither the user
 * nor the orchestrator that opened it could tell that apart from a node still waiting on a
 * dependency.
