/**
 * Whether the trackpad override is live at all — the `mac` argument every method below takes.
 *
 * Two reasons it must be one named expression rather than an `isMac &&` at each call site: the
 * router and React Flow's own `panOnScroll` have to agree exactly (disagreeing means a gesture
 * that neither of them pans), and `trackpadPan` is the user's ESCAPE HATCH. Turning it off
 * restores the pre-router behavior on macOS — `wheelZoom` alone decides, and a plain wheel zooms.
 * On the desktop the hatch is rarely needed anymore: main-process gesture reporting (the
 * `gestureReporting` constructor flag below) identifies the device as a fact, so a precise-pixel
 * MOUSE (Magic Mouse, MX Master) reaches wheel zoom while the trackpad keeps panning. It remains
 * the recourse where reporting does not exist — the Server Edition's browser tab — whose
 * heuristics still classify such a mouse as a trackpad.
