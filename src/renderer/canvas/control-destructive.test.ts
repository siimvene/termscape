/**
 * A STRUCTURAL test on purpose.
 *
 * `DESTRUCTIVE` / `isDestructiveVerb` named `write` and `close` as "the confirm-gated set" and was
 * read by nothing but its own unit test — it could not be anything else, because it lived in
 * `src/main` and the dispatch is in the renderer, which cannot import from there. The refusal was
 * a hand-written `if (confirmBusy())` inside each of the two `switch (verb)` cases, so the SET
 * decided nothing, while `TOLERANT_CONTROL_VERBS`' doc comment, `hook-server.ts`'s `buildPtyEnv`
 * note and `docs/node-identity.md:65` all name it as what decides.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS: a drift alarm, not proof of a gate. The dialog is still hand-written in each
 * case, so these assertions cannot show that a verb IS confirmed — only that the set and the cases
 * that read it still agree, in both directions. That is the thing that had already broken once.
 * `close-worktree --mode remove` is confirmed by a human through `requestRemoveWorktree` and is
 * deliberately outside the set, so it is invisible here by design.
 *
 * Structural because there is no unit seam — the switch lives inside a 7000-line React component's
 * IPC listener — and because the failure mode being pinned is exactly "a reader trusts the
 * constant", which is a property of the SOURCE. So the source is the subject.
