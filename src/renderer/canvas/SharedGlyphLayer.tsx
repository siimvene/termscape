/**
 * The MOUNTING SURFACE of the glyphgrid renderer (Phase 1b): the one WebGL2 canvas every
 * terminal on the board paints into, the rAF driver that submits its frames, and the two feeds
 * the canvas owns — the camera and the node paint order.
 *
 * Three things live here and nowhere else:
 *
 * 1. **The engine singleton.** ONE GL context for the whole canvas is the entire point of the
 *    shared renderer (the per-terminal path fights Chromium's ~16-context cap through
 *    `terminal/webgl-budget.ts`; see the WebGL section of CLAUDE.md). So the context is a module
 *    singleton, not component state: it must survive `<SharedGlyphLayer/>` remounting, and it is
 *    created LAZILY — a user who never turns the experimental mode on must never cost a GPU
 *    context, which is why `getSharedGlyphContext()` returns null while the mode is off.
 * 2. **The failure path, and the one recovery.** `GlyphGridEngine.frame()` RETHROWS on a GL error
 *    by contract (it restores its damage first), and that lands on `failSharedGlyph()`: warn once,
 *    tear the context down, and flip the store's `failed` — the session-level "everyone back to
 *    the DOM renderer" signal that TerminalNode reads. A LOST CONTEXT is no longer one of those: it
 *    arrives as an event rather than a throw, and it is restored ONCE per context
 *    (`createContextLossPolicy` → `engine.suspendGpu` / `reviveGpu`), because a GPU reset is what
 *    macOS does on sleep/wake and the shared renderer is meant to be the default. A second loss
 *    inside the cooldown, or a rebuild that throws, falls back through the same `failSharedGlyph`.
 *    **A GPU reset has a SECOND half**: it also blanks the OffscreenCanvas the atlas rasterizes
 *    into, and that one cannot be restored — its pixels are gone while `GlyphAtlas.slots` still
 *    claims every key is cached, which is the "every terminal went blank at once" report. It is
 *    answered by the same policy object driving `rebuildSharedContext` instead of a revive
 *    (`createContext`'s `atlasLoss`), and by a pixel check on the revive path for the silent case
 *    that fires no event at all (`reviveGpuOrRebuild`, `ATLAS_SENTINEL_RGBA`).
 * 3. **The seams the rest of the integration reads**: `useSharedGlyph` (mode + generation +
 *    failure), `setNodeZOrder`/`nodeZFor`/`subscribeNodeZOrder` (paint order),
 *    `setOpaqueNodeIds`/`nodeIsOpaque`/`subscribeOpaqueSet` (which terminals must leave the shared
 *    canvas — see the stacking rule above that set), and `setSharedGlyphCamera` (pan/zoom). Every
 *    one of them is a no-op while no context exists, so Canvas can call them unconditionally and a
 *    default-mode user pays a null check.
 *
 * The component and the GL singleton have NO unit tests by design — there is no WebGL2, no
 * OffscreenCanvas and no layout in vitest's node environment. The pure parts (order signature,
 * store transitions, z map) are tested; the rest is on the T6 device checklist. That split is the
 * same one `terminal/glyphgrid-attach.ts` makes for xterm's internals.

 *  room for a few thousand `(code, style, fg, bg)` slots. Under the old monochrome keying that was
 *  a whole session's glyph REPERTOIRE; under colour keying the same repertoire costs one slot per
 *  colour pair it is ever drawn in, so the page is a working set rather than a cache of everything.
 *
 *  Which is why filling it is a NORMAL event, not a failure: `GlyphAtlas` answers a full page by

 *
 *  - Every node is `selected ? 1000 : 0`.
 *  - A CHILD is then `parentZ >= childZ ? parentZ + 1 : childZ`, its parent resolved first (React
 *    Flow requires parents before children in the array, which `nodeStatesToFlow` guarantees).
 *
 * What that means on this canvas: a group FRAME is z 0, tied with every ungrouped node — so array
 * order decides between them, and since frames sort FIRST, an ungrouped terminal overlapping a
 * populated frame paints ON TOP of it. A frame's child is 1, above both. A selected frame is 1000

 *
 * **Two wrong models have been shipped here; both are worth naming.** Round 5's first cut modelled
 * selection only, which put a grouped terminal BELOW an ungrouped one it is in fact above. Its
 * replacement transcribed the `'auto'` branch, complete with the `ROOT_PARENT_Z_INCREMENT` banding
 * that gives a populated frame z 10 — which is gated on `zIndexMode === 'auto'` and therefore never
 * runs here. That one said an ungrouped terminal sitting on a frame was BELOW the frame, so the
 * terminal stayed transparent and the frame's border and label pill showed through it: exactly the
 * ghost this round exists to delete. The lesson is in the verification, not the reading — the model
 * is now checked against the real `adoptUserNodes`, and the tests state the numbers it returns.
 *
 * With the banding gone the model carries no order-dependent state, which also removes the
 * `checkEquality` caveat this comment used to carry: z depends only on `selected` and the parent
 * chain, React Flow recomputes every CHILD on each adopt regardless of reuse, and a reused ROOT's

/**
 * THE STACKING RULE OF THE SHARED RENDERER, and the thing to read before touching any of this.
 *
 * A shared-mode terminal is a TRANSPARENT WINDOW: its body has no background, its text lives on
 * the one canvas that sits UNDER the whole node layer, and the only thing it puts between itself
 * and whatever is behind it is its grid's opaque plate — which is also on that canvas, i.e. also
 * under every node's DOM chrome. So a glyph terminal cannot occlude a node beneath it the way an
 * ordinary node does. It can hide the node's canvas TEXT (plate over plate) but never its chrome:
 * the border, the header seam, a label pill all paint straight through.
 *
 * There is no z-ordering that fixes that, in either world — one canvas cannot interleave itself
 * with per-node DOM stacking. Round 4 tried to make the two orders agree by taking selection
 * elevation away; that removed "click/drag brings it to the front", which is not negotiable.
 *
 * Round 5's rule instead: **a terminal renders through the shared canvas only while it is in the
 * open.** The moment its body could reveal something underneath, it drops the grid and goes back
 * to xterm's own DOM renderer — opaque body, native stacking, total occlusion. Concretely a
 * terminal is OPAQUE (DOM) when either holds:
 *
 *  a) its rect intersects the rect of ANY node — of any kind — that is BELOW it in the effective
 *     paint order (`effectiveStackOrder`), or
 *  b) it is in a GESTURE: it, or a group frame containing it, is being dragged or resized. A
 *     gesture is "about to be above things", and holding the node opaque for its whole duration is
 *     also what lets the rect sweep be frozen while `nodes` churns per frame. This set carries the
 *     answer (`gestureTerminalIds`, which is the only thing that can see the children of a dragged
 *     FRAME); TerminalNode additionally reads its own `dragging` prop, which flips synchronously
 *     and needs nobody — two sources for one state, deliberately, and documented at both.
 *
 * A terminal that is only UNDERNEATH others stays on the canvas: the opaque node above it hides it
 * natively, which is the case this whole design leans on. The cost is that a stacked terminal is
 * rendered by the DOM renderer for as long as it is stacked — its text is very slightly softer at
 * zoom ≠ 1 than its neighbours', which is the expected tell, not a defect.
 *
 * Two deliberate exclusions from "below it":
 *  - **A node's own ANCESTOR chain.** Every grouped terminal sits inside its group frame's rect by
 *    construction; counting that as an overlap would put every grouped terminal on the DOM
 *    renderer forever, which would gut the feature on the canvases most likely to use it.
 *  - **Nodes with unknowable geometry** (no `measured`, no `width`/`height` — the tick before
 *    React Flow has measured a fresh node). They contribute nothing in either direction, and the
 *    measurement lands as an ordinary nodes change that recomputes the set.
 *
 * TWO KNOWN GAPS, stated rather than papered over — a device tester must not file either as a bug:
 *  - The EPHEMERAL subagent/loop cards are merged into React Flow at the `<ReactFlow>` prop and are
 *    not in Canvas's `nodes` array, so they are invisible to this rule. A card can therefore sit
 *    over a glyph terminal and be visible through its body. They are display-only, they live for
 *    the length of one turn, and putting them in the rule means putting them in the nodes array,
 *    which is precisely what keeps them out of persistence and undo.
 *  - The rule compares NODE RECTS, and two node-attached surfaces deliberately escape their node's
 *    rect: the 💬 comments flyout (`.term-node__comments`) and the kanban `ColumnPill`, both
 *    siblings of the overflow:hidden node root. A NEIGHBOUR's flyout or pill overhanging a glyph
 *    terminal is not seen here, so it can show through that terminal's body. Fixing it means
 *    feeding real chrome geometry into the rule — a Phase-2 question, and the same one L15's other
 *    Phase-2 answer (chrome on the canvas) settles for free.

 * THE PRODUCER'S CONTRACT, in three parts, because the clock cannot enforce any of them:
 *  1. **Set on focus, cleared on blur.** The clock's "is anything focused" gate IS this value; a
 *     target left behind by a blurred terminal is a repaint twice a second for a cursor nobody is
 *     on.
 *  2. **`setPhase` must repaint SYNCHRONOUSLY.** The clock brackets the call to route the damage it
 *     produces through `pulse()` instead of `wake()` (see `routeDamage`); a phase applied through a
 *     deferred/debounced redraw would land outside that bracket, take the wake path, and put the
 *     idle canvas back at the display's refresh rate — the exact failure this whole design avoids.
 *  3. **Both halves of the cursor.** A block cursor is a CELL rewrite and every other shape is an
 *     overlay (see `glyphgrid/cursor.ts`), so hiding it for a phase means suppressing whichever of
 *     the two this terminal is currently drawing — not just the overlay.
 * A terminal that stops being the target must leave its own cursor SHOWN; the clock restores the
 * target it still holds, but it cannot reach one that has already been dropped.
 *
 * THE PRODUCER is `GlyphGridRendererAddonCore` — `setCursorBlinkPhase` for (2) and (3), published
 * on its own focus edges for (1) through the `blink` seam the attach shell supplies
 * (`terminal/glyphgrid-attach.ts`). It has to be the addon: it is the only thing that tracks which
 * terminal has focus and the only thing that holds both halves of a cursor.
