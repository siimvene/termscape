// Does this window draw the macOS traffic lights inside our own tab bar? Stamped on <html> before
// the first paint so the tab bar reserves room for them only where they exist (issue #564: on
// Windows/Linux and in a Server Edition browser tab there are none, and the reservation pushed the
// logo in and squeezed the tabs). Runs after main.tsx's shell switch, so the browser flag is set.
applyWindowChrome()

// Register the custom-agent → baseAgent resolver so the capability predicates (hasHooks, canResume,
// canControlCanvas, …) resolve a custom agent's inherited harness. Reads the live settings store.

// Probe the local Claude CLI once, up front (never awaited — a launch is never blocked on it):
// `--permission-mode auto` only exists in Claude Code >= 2.1.71, and until we know the version we
// conservatively omit the flag. The shell warms the same memo at startup, so this normally
// resolves immediately.
void ensureClaudeCliCaps()
// Same, for grok: its own probe, kicked off at boot so a node created seconds later already has
// the real answer instead of the fail-open one.
void ensureGrokCliCaps()

// Same shape, same reason: a Codex launch line names the managed shared-identity launcher only if
// this machine has one installed and armed. Unprobed ⇒ plain `codex`, which is what every Codex
// node ran before this feature — never a launcher path that might not resolve.
void ensureCodexIdentityCaps()

// One env snapshot for `${env:VAR}` expansion, fetched up front and cached (src/renderer/lib/
// agentEnv.ts): the Settings preview and every launch path expand against the same object, so the
// preview cannot drift from the typed command. Browser/relay bridges resolve `{}` by design and
// expansion degrades to the missing-env refusal. Not awaited — an unexpanded first-frame launch
// of a `${env:…}`-referencing custom agent refuses via missingEnv rather than blocking boot.
void refreshAgentEnv()

// Note: StrictMode is intentionally not used — its double mount in dev would open
// two PTY sessions per terminal node.
