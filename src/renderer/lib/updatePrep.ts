// Prepare-for-update (Windows session host, issue #829) — the PURE half of the flow: given what the
// running host holds and what the app knows about each node, decide which sessions block the
// update, which agents get asked to quit cleanly first, and what the confirm dialog must say will
// stop. Every rule here is a refusal or a disclosure, never a guess:
//
//   • a session whose agent is WORKING, waiting on a question or blocked on an approval blocks the
//     whole flow — ending it would abandon a turn or throw away the dialog's answer. Either source
//     saying so is enough: the renderer's store (live for mounted nodes) or core's status mirror
//     (which also covers nodes in projects that are not on screen, closed projects included);
//   • only a node that is MOUNTED can be asked to `/exit` (its pane closure is registered by the
//     node itself); an agent in an unmounted project is listed as "stops without a clean exit" —
//     its conversation resumes from its last saved turn;
//   • a host session no project knows (an orphan) is still ended and is counted, never hidden.
//
// Nothing here ever deletes a node: the update ends processes, and the canvas cold-restores.
