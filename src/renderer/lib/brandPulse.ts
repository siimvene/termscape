// The brand marks, and the decision of when one of them IS an agent's working indicator.
//
// This module is deliberately REACT-FREE, like lib/grokMark.ts and lib/mascot.ts: the notch HUD
// (hud/main.ts) builds its DOM imperatively and must not pull React into its bundle, yet it needs
// the exact same answer the canvas badge needs. So the decision lives here as a pure function, and
// each surface keeps its own thin renderer on top of it (`BrandPulse` in agentIcons.tsx for React,
// `workingMascot` in hud/main.ts for plain DOM).

// Brand logo per builtin agent; custom/unknown agents have none (callers fall back to the terminal
// glyph, or to the plain pulsing dot).
//
// These asset marks carry their own fills and are loaded as an `<img src>` /
// `background-image` (Vite hands us a URL). An SVG loaded that way is an isolated document —
// `currentColor` has nothing to inherit there, which is why none of these assets uses it. Grok and
// copilot are the exception: their marks are monochrome, so they are inlined from lib/grokMark.ts
// / lib/copilotMark.ts instead, and are therefore NOT in this map. Pi's mark is an original glyph
// (a stylized lowercase pi in a rounded square, its own brand color `#d4009a`), not a third-party
// logo, drawn as an asset like gemini/opencode/codex because its rounded-square fill is part of the
// mark itself, not something `currentColor` should repaint per theme.

 * An agent's own brand mark as its working indicator — pulsing with a bloom instead of walking.
 *
 * This is the pattern grok arrived at after a hand-drawn quadrant critter was rejected: standing
 * next to two real mascots (claude's painted blob, codex's pet) an invented creature read as
 * neither, so the glyph the agent actually has is what animates. gemini and opencode were falling
 * through to the plain dot, which says "something is happening" but not WHO.
 *
 * Returns null when the agent has no mark (custom agents, plain terminals), so the caller falls back
 * to that dot rather than rendering an empty box. It does NOT know which agents have mascot art:
 * claude and codex have marks too, and their sprite branches come FIRST in each surface's
 * dispatcher, next to the spritesheet geometry they need.
 *
 * A caveat worth knowing: the bloom is a `drop-shadow` of the element's `color`, which is exactly
 * right for a MONOCHROME mark painted in `currentColor` (grok) and approximate for the multi-colour
 * assets — gemini's gradient mark and codex's white one bloom in the label colour, not their own
 * ink. That is accepted: the halo reads as a glow either way, and per-mark bloom colours would mean
 * an ink table.
