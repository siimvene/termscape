 * allows it again). `control-taken` — someone can now type in this terminal — also raises an OS
 * notification. It is a SECURITY event, not an agent finishing, so it is gated on the notification
 * consent alone (`notifyConsentAsked`: the one-time question was answered, so no OS prompt comes out of
 * nowhere), never on the agent-done preference (`notifyOnClaudeDone`); main shows it only while the
 * window is unfocused, and at most once per link per 5 s. `lastOsAt` is the caller's per-link cooldown
 * record; it is written only when a notification is raised.
