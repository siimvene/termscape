// Every way this desktop (re)joins a hosted team, over ONE attempt owner per team (hostedAttempts.ts):
//  - boot: each APPROVED bookmark reconnects on its own, in the background;
//  - a drop: a live hosted tab whose connection dropped (no host reason) reconnects in place, in the
//    background, while its team is still bookmarked and approved and the tab is still open;
//  - a click on the greyed tab: reconnects in place now (no pairing-code prompt — the bookmark is the
//    credential) — unless the team was forgotten since, and then it asks for a code;
//  - a pasted join code: joins now, into the team's own tab when it has one, and is told why if it
//    cannot;
//  - the share flow (`joinApproved`): a team this desktop just set up itself joins now, retrying
//    while its relay comes up, with no SAS (its bookmark is pre-approved);
//  - forgetting a team: stops its loop and removes its bookmark (the host is not touched);
//  - closing or deleting a tab: its team's attempt stops, in any phase (R40) — unless the team has
//    other tabs open (one connection serves one tab per shared project): then the attempt moves to
//    one of those (`tabRemoved`), and tabs a share event opens later join the team (`tabsAdded`).
// And what the user is told for each: one sentence per stop, nothing for a retry in progress, one
// notice when the quick retries of a drop run out, a "remove and rejoin" offer after a revocation,
// and "waiting for an owner" whenever a mount is still unapproved after a moment. Pure over
// injected deps (no React, no window).
// See docs/hosted-team-relay.md.
