/**
 * "Zoom to this node" geometry, computed WITHOUT React Flow's measurements.
 *
 * Why this exists: `fitView({ nodes: [{ id }] })` is the natural way to frame one node, and it is
 * what `Canvas.goToNode` uses — but React Flow filters the fit set down to nodes it has already
 * MEASURED (`getFitViewNodes` keys off `measured.width && measured.height`; there is no
 * `width`/`height` fallback there). A node that was handed to React Flow a tick ago has no
 * measurement yet, so the fit set comes out EMPTY, its bounds collapse to `{0,0,0,0}` and the
 * camera flies to the canvas ORIGIN at max zoom — an empty stretch of canvas, nowhere near the
 * node. That is exactly the window a cross-project focus lands in: switch project → load its nodes
 * → focus the target, all before React Flow's mount-time measuring has run. (Clicking an OS
 * notification for a session in another project is the everyday path into it; the same node focuses
 * correctly on a second try, once it is measured.)
 *
 * So for the unmeasured case we do the same maths ourselves from the size the node was persisted
 * with — which needs no layout — and drive the camera with `setViewport`.
