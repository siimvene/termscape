// Which download route (if any) the Explorer offers for the tree it is currently showing.
//
// "Download" only means something when the file is NOT already on the user's machine, and the two
// cases where it isn't are reached by completely different transports:
//
//  - **Desktop + SSH project** — the tree is another host's filesystem, so the file comes down over
//    the project's ControlMaster with `scp` and lands in the OS Downloads folder. This is the only
//    route that streams straight to disk, which is why big files must take it.
//  - **Browser (Server Edition)** — every file in the tree is on the server, including a "local"
//    project's. The transfer is a plain HTTP GET against a one-shot ticket, and the browser saves
//    it. NOT `fs.readBinary`: that base64s the whole file into one RPC message and is capped.
//
// Everything else answers `none`, and the affordance is hidden rather than shown-and-broken:
//  - **Desktop + local project** — the file is already on this machine; Reveal in Finder is the
//    honest action, and it is right there in the same menu.
//  - **Relay tab** — the files are on the peer's machine and the only path to them is the bridged
//    `fs.readBinary`, i.e. the capped base64 one. Offering a Download that silently truncates a
//    25 MB file would be worse than not offering it; a real relay transport is follow-up work.
