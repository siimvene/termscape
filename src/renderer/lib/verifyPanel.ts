 * then pushed further right/down only as far as needed to clear existing top-level nodes/frames.
 * The push reuses `freeSpot`'s ring search — one layout engine, not a second one.
 *
 * Anchoring OUTSIDE the frame's right edge is also what makes the panel a top-level SIBLING of the
 * target's frame rather than a child of it: the target's frame may be worktree-bound, and reviewers
 * nested inside it would inherit that cwd — a panel reviews the checkout, it must not fork it. The
 * caller keeps the panel at the top level; this function only guarantees it lands beside, not over.
