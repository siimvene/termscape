 *    only thing that steers `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` at spawn.
 *  - `ObservedClaudeAccount` — what the RUNNING session's hooks reported (agent-status store).
 *    For a plain terminal where the user ran `export CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.claude-2; claude`, this
 *    is the only identity that exists anywhere.
 *
 * Everything here is pure and display/read-only. An observed account is a LABEL (see the
 * `ObservedClaudeAccount` doc comment in shared/types): it may decide what we SHOW and whose
 * transcripts we READ, never what is permitted — so nothing in this module is a gate.
 *
 * PASS THE LIVE `accounts` LIST AT EVERY CALL SITE. It is optional only so the parameter could be
 * added without touching every caller, and the default `[]` is not "don't resolve" — it means "no
 * accounts exist", which is a real state (the user just unlinked their only one) and makes
 * `resolveObserved` degrade every observed id to its bare dir. Omitting it therefore reads as
 * "every account was removed", which is exactly wrong in the one case it matters.

/**
 * Re-resolve an observation against the CURRENT account list.
 *
 * The hook server classifies `transcript_path` at POST time, so an observation is frozen as of the
 * account list that existed then — and nothing else would ever revisit it: a quiet pane may not
 * post another hook for hours. Linking and unlinking are settings edits, so the renderer is the
 * only place that can notice, and this is where it does. Everything else in this module goes
 * through it, so the chip, the keys, the detected list and the readers cannot disagree about the
 * same dir.
 *
 * Two directions, and both are about the DIR, which is the one fact that outlives the record:
 *  - unknown dir + an account now claiming it  ⇒ that account (the link case);
 *  - a known id that no longer exists          ⇒ back to the bare dir, `known: false` (the unlink
 *    or remove case). Without this the pane showed "Unknown account" and its dir vanished from
 *    Settings → Detected, so there was no way back to Link short of waiting for the next turn.
 *    A re-link under a NEW id is picked up by the same dir match, hence one code path.
 *
 * The system account (`known` with `accountId: null`) is never touched: it has no record to lose.
 * `data.accountId` is likewise untouched — a NODE created under a removed account still reads
 * "Unknown account", which is correct: that binding really is dangling.
 *
 * **A REMOTE observation is never dir-matched against a local account** (`observed.remote`), in
 * either direction. `ClaudeAccount.configDir` is set only by `claudeAccounts.link`, which is a
 * LOCAL adoption — the path it stores names a directory on this machine — while a remote pane's
 * dir names one on its host, and `~/.claude-2` on a server and `~/.claude-2` here spell the same
 * string whenever the two machines share a username, which is the ordinary case rather than a
 * corner. Matching them would label the remote pane with a local account's identity, and
 * `effectiveAccountId` would then hand that id to the LOCAL transcript, session-name and usage
 * readers.
 *
 * **An id is not automatically safer than a path — it depends on where the id came from.** The
 * dir-match refusal above is not the whole story, because the FIRST dir match already happened in
 * core: `classifyClaudeConfigDir`'s linked rule compares the posted dir against every linked
 * account's `configDir`, is host-agnostic by design, and runs at POST time, before the renderer
 * has stamped `remote`. So when a local linked account holds `/home/me/.claude-2` and an SSH
 * pane posts a transcript under the host's `/home/me/.claude-2`, the observation arrives here
 * ALREADY `{known: true, accountId: '<the local linked id>'}` — it never reaches the dir-match
 * refusal, because the id branch returns first. A remote observation resolving to a LINKED account
 * (`isLocallyLinkedAccount`) is therefore demoted to the bare dir, which is exactly the answer the
 * dir-match refusal would have given had core not got there first.
 *
 * Managed-remote observations are unaffected, and that is the non-regression: they arrive
 * `known: true` carrying a real `accountId` (classifier rule 2, `~/.nodeterm/claude-accounts/<id>`)
 * whose account row has `host` set, so it is an id derived from a path SHAPE that means the same
 * thing on either machine — not a claim about a directory on this one. Managed LOCAL accounts
 * (rule 1, no `configDir`) are left alone too, deliberately: reaching one from a remote path would
 * take a host holding this machine's whole `<userData>/claude-accounts` path, while demoting them
 * would be paid regularly by the case below.
 *
 * **The cost, stated plainly:** `remote` is one boolean and `observationIsRemote(undefined)` is
 * TRUE, so a LOCAL linked pane whose node no canvas holds any more (a tmux session outliving the
 * node that named it) is demoted here too — its chip becomes the bare dir and its readers fall
 * back to the system root. That is the same trade the flag was introduced under: one label fewer,
 * never a wrong one. Splitting "on a host" from "cannot place this node" to recover it would
 * reinstate exactly the "unknown ⇒ local" guess `observationIsRemote` refuses to make.
