/**
 * What the UI calls the machine nodeterm is running on.
 *
 * There used to be no such helper: 30-odd user-visible strings said "this Mac", including the
 * license and team-access copy. On Windows that is untidy in Accounts and actively harmful in
 * billing — a user reading *"This Mac is not authorized on this license"* can no longer tell
 * whether the sentence is even about their machine, and *"a teammate on a seat can run commands
 * on this Mac"* is the sentence someone has to trust before handing out shell access (issue #563).
 *
 * One definition, so a new string cannot reintroduce the assumption, and so the noun agrees
 * everywhere it appears in one dialog.
 *
 * **A brand name is only used where we KNOW the machine.** The desktop renderer runs on the host
 * it describes, so the OS sniff is authoritative there. A Server Edition browser tab does not:
 * the license, the seats and the sessions belong to the SERVER, whose OS the viewer's `navigator`
 * says nothing about — so a browser tab always gets the neutral word rather than a confident
 * wrong one. Same for any non-DOM context.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT applied to copy that really is macOS-specific: `PtyPressureBanner`
 * (`kern.tty.ptmx_max`) and the onboarding notch step (which only exists on macOS).
