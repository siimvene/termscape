/**
 * Shared "Transfer conversation to" menu builder.
 *
 * Previously the transfer-target list was built inline inside `selectionItems` in Canvas.tsx (the
 * canvas node right-click menu). The sessions-sidebar row right-click wanted the SAME submenu, so
 * the list-building is extracted here and consumed by both — one definition, two surfaces.
 *
 * Each transfer target that is **model-discovery-capable** (`canSwitchModel`, base-resolved — so a
 * claude-base custom agent qualifies) becomes a NESTED submenu: the agent's default model, plus one
 * row per discovered gateway model, mirroring the "Switch model" submenu's children. A non-capable
 * target (e.g. gemini, grok) stays a flat row — it has no model grammar, so there is nothing to
 * pick. `transferTargets` and the nesting are pure (no React, no stores) so they unit-test cleanly;
 * the caller reads the live settings/agent-status/gateway stores and passes the values in.
