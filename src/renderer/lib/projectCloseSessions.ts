// Closing/deleting a project vs. the tmux sessions it parks (issue #442).
//
// `closeProject` is deliberately NON-destructive — the tab hides, the project stays on disk, and
// its tmux sessions keep running so reopening picks them up warm. That contract is kept. What was
// missing is that nothing SAID so at the moment of the action, and nothing afterwards showed that
// the parked sessions exist: a closed project is filtered out of the tab bar and the sessions
// sidebar, so "close" read like cleanup while actually meaning "hide, and keep running".
//
// This module is the pure half of the fix:
//  - `planProjectClose` decides whether closing needs a confirm (and how many sessions it must
//    name), with an opt-in "end its sessions too" — the default stays parking.
//  - `deleteConfirmCopy` words the permanent delete (the "Recently closed" ×), distinguishing
//    what is removed HERE from what continues to exist elsewhere (a relay tab is only a view of
//    another machine's project; an SSH/local delete never deletes the folder or its
//    .nodeterm/project.json).
//  - `closedSessionCounts` maps a live session sweep onto closed projects for the start screen's
//    per-row badge.
//
// ONE definition of "N sessions" on the dialogs: the project's TERMINAL-kind nodes — exactly the
// set the action addresses (`transport.destroy` per node id, idempotent on an already-dead
// session). Working, idle, hibernated and already-exited all count, because the action tells each
// of them to stop; a liveness-verified count here would let the button and the action disagree
// the moment a session exits between the count and the confirm. The start-screen badge is the
// OPPOSITE: it reports sessions that exist, so it derives from a live sweep and never from node
// counts — and `ok:false` is not "0 sessions" (the session-memory rule), so no sweep ⇒ no badge.
