 * "Set folder…" (tab ⌄) points an EXISTING project — typically a cwd-less "New project" — at a
 * directory. That single act promotes the project from an INLINE canvas (stored verbatim inside
 * `workspace.json`) to a REF whose canvas is written to `<cwd>/.nodeterm/project.json`.
 *
 * It is therefore a WRITE into a folder we may never have read, and until this module existed it
 * did exactly that: the very next autosave overwrote whatever canvas the folder already held. A
 * teammate's committed `project.json` (rev 40, its own nodes) came back as this project's canvas at
 * rev 1, with no sideline copy and nothing on screen to say it had happened. "Open folder…" never
 * had the bug — it probes and ADOPTS (`openOrAdoptFolder`) — so the two entrances to the same
 * "attach a folder" idea disagreed, and the destructive one was the one a scratch project leads to.
 *
 * The decision is pure and lives here so both the refusal and its reason are testable, and so the
 * rule reads as one thing rather than as three branches inside a Canvas callback.
