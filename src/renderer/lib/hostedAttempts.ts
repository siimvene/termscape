// The one owner of a hosted team's connection attempts in the renderer: AT MOST ONE attempt and one
// live connection per team (hostId), shared by the boot reconnect, a dropped tab's reconnect and a
// manual "join with code" (R38/R39).
//
// Why one: a second connect for a team whose first is still in flight opens a second pending request
// at the host, which REPLACES the first and closes its socket — the user would see a refusal for an
// attempt nobody declined. Main refuses a duplicate while it is minting and joining
// (`[E_JOIN_BUSY]`), but its lock releases once the relay client exists, which is before the SAS
// dialog and the owner's approval. This owner holds the team through all of it: connecting → the
// approval wait / tab mount → live, until that connection closes.
//
// Why only network failures retry (R35): every other code needs a person (a fresh code, an unlocked
// keyring, an owner) or a new day, and a loop on one of them spends the team's damped device mints.
// The service's per-network limiter (E_JOIN_THROTTLED, a 429 that clears within a minute) retries
// too, but never sooner than a minute (or its Retry-After), on the 60 s tail, announced once per
// streak (R41). A connection that drops before the host answered (a host restarting) is the other
// retry, and it is BOUNDED (R40): the 1/2/4/8/15 s steps, then it stops and says so once — every
// try mints a join token and opens a relay socket. A reconnect after a LIVE connection dropped
// starts on the first rung, never at once (R41). And no attempt outlives its tab: `wanted` is asked
// before every retry and before every mount, and closing the tab cancels the attempt in any phase.
// Pure orchestration over injected deps, so every rule is testable without React or a relay.
// See docs/hosted-team-relay.md.
