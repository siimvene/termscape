 *  persistence path whose only failure report is a swallowed promise is one the user cannot act
 *  on, and cannot even know about.
 *
 *  The bug this closes (field report, Server Edition, 2026-09-02): the canvas stopped being
 *  written to disk for two and a half hours while eight session cards were opened and several
 *  closed, and nothing anywhere said so. `void api.workspace.save(...)` threw its rejection away,
 *  and — worse — the debounce that would have retried was armed by an effect whose only deps are
 *  `dirty`, the conflict bar, a stable callback and a tick. A save that rejects leaves `dirty`
 *  TRUE, so every later edit's `setDirty(true)` is a no-op, no dep changes, the effect never
 *  re-runs, and the 800 ms timer is never scheduled again. One refused save ended persistence for
 *  the life of the tab. Nothing retried it and nothing reported it.
