 * (group/subagent/loop/account-login nodes are excluded from both). `allNodes` must be the FULL
 * live tree from BEFORE the deletion, so parent-chain absolute positions are still resolvable.
 * `now`/`makeId` are injected so this stays a pure, deterministically testable function; call
 * sites pass `Date.now()` and a `uuid` (`lib/uuid.ts`)-backed minter — NEVER `crypto.randomUUID`,
 * which is absent outside a secure context and so throws in the Server Edition served over plain
 * HTTP on a LAN.
 *
 * `makeId` is handed the SOURCE node's id (not called bare) so the caller (`deleteNodes`) can
 * record which minted entry id belongs to which node — that correlation is what lets a ⇧⌘T
 * snapshot and its persisted twin consume each other on reopen (see
 * `ReopenNodeSnapshot.closedSessionId`). Correlating by node id rather than by array position
 * keeps the two histories' independent filtering passes from ever silently misaligning.
