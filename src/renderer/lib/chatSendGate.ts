 * May the ⌘M chat composer type into the agent's pane right now — and if not, why?
 *
 * `pty.sendText` pastes the text and then presses Enter. That is a prompt only while the agent's
 * input box owns the pane. Two ways it does not:
 *
 * - **A TUI dialog** (`waiting`/`blocked`). Claude's PermissionRequest AND AskUserQuestion both
 *   normalize to `waiting` (`shared/agents/normalize.ts`), a permission Notification to `blocked`.
 *   The pane then holds a select dialog the transcript view does not show, and Enter CONFIRMS the
 *   highlighted option — "Yes" by default. A chat message would silently grant a permission or
 *   pick an answer. Same trap CLAUDE.md documents for the in-place restart's `/exit`.
 * - **A SHELL**: the CLI is no longer in the pane — Eco hibernated it, it was paused, it died
 *   unaccounted for (DROPPED), or it announced its own exit (`/exit`, `/quit`, Ctrl+D → SessionEnd,
 *   which Canvas records as `state: undefined` + `sessionEnded`). The message would be EXECUTED as
 *   a shell command. Hibernation even leaves `state` at `done`, and an exit leaves it undefined, so
 *   the state alone reads "sendable" either way; this check therefore ranks ABOVE the state.
 *
 * Whether the CLI is in the pane is NOT decided here: it is `agentProcessInPane`
 * (`terminal/live-work.ts`), the one rule the memory levers already use. A second copy of that flag
 * set would drift the day a new "CLI gone" flag lands. The specific kinds below only pick the
 * sentence; an unrecognised "not in pane" still refuses, as the generic `exited`.
 *
 * No hook knowledge (`state` undefined and no flags — a custom agent, a session with no event yet
 * in this app run) is ALLOWED: unknown is not unsafe, and refusing it would take the composer away
 * from every such node. Only `done` is a positive "input box is up".

/**
 * The composer's placeholder — the one place the user learns WHY it is disabled, naming the
 * node's own agent (the panel serves grok and base-claude custom agents too, not only Claude).
 *
 * A dialog points back at the terminal through the chord actually bound to the markdown/chat
 * toggle (`chip`, from `chipFor('node.toggleMarkdown')`); `''` = unbound, and then the text names
 * the action instead of promising a chord that never fires. A shell-owned pane names the header
 * chip that resumes it — the same SLEEPING / PAUSED / DROPPED chip whose click runs the wake, shown
 * in the header of the canvas node and of the kanban card modal alike (hence "the header"). An
 * exited CLI has no such chip: it is relaunched in the terminal itself. A write failure
 * (`readonly`) outranks everything: no state change will make that session writable.
 *
 * `answerOnCard`: the dialog is a held plan / question whose card in the thread carries answer
 * controls (`lib/chatAnswer.ts`), so the copy points at the card first and keeps the terminal as
 * the fallback — the card is the shorter path, the terminal still works.
