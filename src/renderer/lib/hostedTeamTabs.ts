// The tabs a hosted team occupies on this desktop: one tab per project the host shares, all served
// by ONE relay connection. The store and the session registry are injected (`TeamTabOps`), so
// everything here is plain bookkeeping that runs under a test without either.
//
// - The tab id IS the host's project id. The relay api translates no ids, so a tab under any other
//   id would ask the host about a project it does not know. A tab is therefore never opened under a
//   derived id: when the store holds a CLOSED relay copy under that id (a former tab of a hosted
//   team), the copy is replaced; when it holds anything else (an open tab, or one of the user's own
//   local projects, closed or not), that project is skipped rather than renamed.
// - `place` runs on every (re)mount of the team's connection: on a reconnect it reuses the team's
//   greyed tabs by id, so their nodes and their place in the tab bar survive, and it unbinds and
//   removes the tabs whose project the host stopped sharing while this desktop was away.
// - `sharedChanged` follows the host's share events while the connection is live: it closes the
//   tabs of unshared projects and opens a tab for each newly shared one. Events for one team run
//   one at a time, each against the set the previous one left; the close half is committed before
//   the workspace load is awaited, so a failed load leaves no half-applied event behind. An event
//   that began before the team remounted (or was closed) changes nothing: the newer mount decided.
// - `closeTab` is the user closing ONE of the team's tabs: it is remembered as dismissed (not
//   reopened while it stays shared) and the connection lives on for the team's other tabs. The last
//   tab's close leaves its binding alone, for the caller that ends the connection, and forgets the
//   team, so a later join in the same run starts clean.
// - A team with nothing shared keeps one placeholder tab named after the team, so the team stays
//   visible and reconnectable instead of vanishing from the tab bar; the first shared project
//   replaces it.
// - When a tab the user was looking at goes away, they land on another of the team's open tabs,
//   never on whatever the store falls back to (which can be a closed project).
//
// Removing a tab here is always a removal from THIS desktop only (`removeTab`), never the
// destroying delete: that would end the host's sessions through the relay transport.
