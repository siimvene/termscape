/**
 * Background keep-alive for webview-hosting nodes (browser/web) across project switches —
 * issue #301's "browser nodes reload their page on every tab change".
 *
 * WHY THIS SHAPE. An Electron `<webview>`'s guest process dies the moment its element leaves the
 * DOM, and — measured on Electron 42.x — it ALSO dies on a DOM *move* (`insertBefore` into a new
 * or even the same parent detaches first), while it survives, state intact, any amount of sibling
 * churn around it and `display:none` of itself or an ancestor (the guest keeps its viewport size
 * and scroll while hidden, repaints pixel-identically on reveal, and its timers keep running,
 * throttled like a background tab). So a page survives a project switch if and only if its
 * `<webview>` element is NEVER unmounted and NEVER reordered relative to the other kept elements —
 * React only calls `insertBefore` on a kept child when its relative order among kept children
 * changes (the `lastPlacedIndex` rule), and that one call is the guest's death.
 *
 * Hence the design: every webview-hosting node renders in ONE stable region at the END of the
 * `<ReactFlow>` nodes prop — the "pool region" — whose internal order is owned by the pool entries
 * here and never changes while an entry lives. The active project's entries render as the live
 * nodes; a background project's render as GHOSTS: same node id (React key stability is the whole
 * point), `display:none`, non-interactive, position parked at the origin. Merging happens at the
 * prop, exactly like the ephemeral subagent cards — Canvas state, persistence, undo and the wire
 * never see a ghost.
 *
 * The invariant every function here preserves, and the one a refactor must not break: **the
 * relative order of surviving entries is identical in consecutive merge outputs.** Appends and
 * removals are fine; a reorder kills a live page. `orderIsStable` in the tests states it directly.
 *
 * Memory bounds (same posture as the park/WebGL budgets — a lever must not end live work):
 *  - the Browser Memory Saver already discards any HIDDEN webview after `BROWSER_DISCARD_MS`
 *    unless it is loading/audible/agent-driven, and a ghost is hidden by construction — the
 *    existing per-surface hook reaps it, and `onGuestDiscarded` then drops the entry (the husk
 *    would otherwise hold a cap slot for a guest that no longer exists);
 *  - `BACKGROUND_WEBVIEW_MAX` hard-caps how many background guests exist at once, evicting the
 *    longest-retired first, for the user who switches through many projects faster than the
 *    saver's window (or who turned the saver off).

 *
 * It carries NO width/height, deliberately. `display:none` keeps React Flow's ResizeObserver from
 * ever measuring it, so an explicit size was the ghost's ONLY geometry — and the MiniMap draws
 * every non-`hidden` node that has one (`nodeHasDimensions`; it ignores `style.display`). The
 * first ship gave the ghost its page's size, and every OTHER project's minimap painted a
 * browser-blue rectangle at its origin that led to empty canvas (field report, 2026-09-01: three
 * web nodes parked from one project, stacked into one phantom on every other). Without a size the
 * minimap skips it and fitView never saw it (that path also demands `measured`). Residual: the
 * ORIGIN itself still enters the minimap's bounds (`getInternalNodesBounds` filters only `hidden`,
 * which we cannot set — a hidden node is unmounted, i.e. a dead guest), so a canvas far from (0,0)
 * gets a slightly zoomed-out minimap while ghosts exist. A point, not a phantom.

/**

 * any other), then any mounted webview node the pool does not know yet (a node created since the
 * last switch), in live array order.
 *
 * `mountedProjectId` is the project `liveNodes` actually BELONGS to (Canvas's
 * `keepAliveFromRef`), and deliberately NOT the active-project id. The two disagree for exactly
 * one commit per switch — the tab click re-renders with the new active id while the load effect
 * has not yet swapped the node array — and pairing entries against the active id there made a
 * returning entry take the live branch, miss its node in the not-yet-swapped array, and drop out
 * of the merged list for that commit: one unmount, guest dead, page reloaded — the precise
 * failure this module exists to prevent ([MEASURED] in the app: ghost→live remounted the wrapper
 * while live→ghost, which has no such window, kept it). Keyed on the mounted project, that
 * commit's output is id-identical to the previous one, and the whole swap lands in the single
 * commit the load effect produces.
 *
 * Hoisting the ACTIVE webview nodes to the tail region is what keeps their DOM position stable
 * across the active↔ghost transitions; the visible cost is a tie-break change — an unselected
 * webview node now paints above other unselected z-0 nodes it overlaps, instead of by creation
 * order. Selection elevation (z 1000) still wins, so anything being dragged or selected stays on
 * top of a page.
