/**
 * The single declarative source of truth for the "add node" content items that appear in the
 * creation menus that can offer every node kind: the canvas pane right-click, the
 * sessions-sidebar project-header "+", and the bottom Dock "+".
 *
 * **The kanban column's "+ New session" is deliberately NOT one of them** — this doc used to list
 * it as a fourth consumer, which was never true and is worth stating so nobody "fixes" it by
 * wiring it up. Its `KanbanCreateChoice` is a closed union of terminal / browser / sticky / agent
 * because those are the only kinds `canvas/toKanbanSession.ts` turns INTO A CARD; feeding it this
 * list would offer kinds (a trigger, a worktree, an editor) that create a node the board can never
 * show. A surface that can only render part of the list is a different list, not a lagging copy.
 *
 * The duplication this kills: each of those surfaces used to hand-maintain its own list of
 * which node kinds you can add, so they drifted out of parity (the pane menu had "New browser" but
 * the Dock and the sidebar "+" did not, etc.). Now they all derive their CONTENT items from
 * {@link CONTENT_ADD_ITEMS}, filtered by project context (cwd / SSH). Agent entries are layered on
 * by each surface from its own source — the ContextMenu-based menus already share
 * `agentCreationItems()`, and the Dock's agent-account hover flyouts are intentionally bespoke UX —
 * so this spec owns the CONTENT list only, not the agents.
 *
 * Three render adapters map the same {@link AddItem} list to the menu worlds:
 *  - {@link buildGroupedAddMenu} → the GROUPED tree the two `ContextMenu` surfaces show (see the
 *    grouping section at the bottom of this file for why, and for the submenu depth cap).
 *  - {@link contentAddItemsToMenuItems} → the {@link MenuItem} type the `ContextMenu` component
 *    consumes (pane menu, project-header "+").
 *  - {@link contentAddItemsToDockRows} → the Dock's custom `<button>` JSX.
 *
 * The handlers are passed in (not imported) so this module stays pure, renderer-side, and testable.
