 * Ensure an attachment's ControlMaster is up, and make sure the scope is REACHABLE either way.
 *
 * Three orderings this gets right, each of which was a live bug:
 *
 * 1. The attachment is registered BEFORE the dial. A first connect that fails is exactly what the
 *    reconnect coordinator is for, and its `connect` dep has nowhere else to learn the endpoint —
 *    recording on success only left a cold load against a sleeping host permanently offline, the
 *    offline overlay's Reconnect included.
 * 2. Also before the dial, because main emits `status:'connected'` from inside its connect — over
 *    the same IPC pipe, so it ARRIVES BEFORE the invoke reply. The reconnector's `onConnected`
 *    then maps scope → owning canvas through `ownerProjectId`, and a record written afterwards is
 *    written too late: the respawn takes the "switched away" branch and never bumps the nonce.
 * 3. Concurrent callers share one dial. Every node on a machine calls this at spawn; without the
 *    in-flight map they would each open a master.
 *
 * It ALWAYS dials — a cached `controlPath` is deliberately not treated as "already connected".
 * Nothing in the renderer clears that path when a connection drops, so a short-circuit on it made
 * the reconnect coordinator a permanent no-op for attachments: after one successful connect it
 * would answer `true` forever, and a sleep/wake respawn would run its pty against a dead socket
 * under `ControlMaster=auto`, which silently falls back to a DIRECT connection per node — the
 * ~72k-logins/day pattern documented on `SshProjectManager.startWatchdog`. Main is the thing that
 * knows whether the master is alive: its connect coalesces per scope and reuse costs one mux'd
 * `-O check`, which doubles as the keepalive that resets the ControlPersist counter. A redundant
 * dial through main is cheap and self-healing; a skipped one is the failure above.
