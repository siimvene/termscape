 * the components read them here instead of re-declaring the literals, so the two
 * can't drift apart.
 *
 * The resizer enforces these only during a drag. Programmatic size changes (e.g.
 * align-to-grid) bypass the resizer, so they must clamp to these values themselves
 * to avoid shrinking a node below what its resizer would allow.
