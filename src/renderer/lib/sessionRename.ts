 * operator never typed. `name` is not ours — it arrives from the canvas-control `rename` verb's
 * `--title` (so from another AGENT), from `generateName`'s model output, and from the workspace
 * file. `oneLine` is what makes the line one line; the name still reads, minus a character that
 * had no glyph.

 * differ only by a control character compose the same command, so a raw `!==` would answer "this
 * is a new name" and push a duplicate.
 *
 * The unchanged case is not cosmetic. Every `/rename` claude receives lands in the transcript as a
 * `local_command`, its `Session renamed to: …` stdout, AND a `<system-reminder>` that tells the
 * model *the user* just named this session — so a re-sent identical name spends the session's
 * context to assert an intent nobody expressed. Issue #582 measured 32 of them in six hours, all
 * carrying the same title; issue #569 §2 is the same push from the orchestrator's side.

 * Push `/rename <name>` into a node's agent session — but ONLY once the agent CLI actually owns

 *
 * `sendText` appends Enter, so writing while a SHELL owns the pane splices the line into whatever
 * that shell is currently reading. For a freshly opened agent node that is its own launch command
 * being typed, and the observed damage was exactly that: `claude '<long prompt>'` cut in half by
 * an interleaved `/rename …`, leaving the shell sitting at `quote>` with the agent never started
 * and the prompt lost. An agent that opens a node and renames it in the same breath — the entire
 * orchestration flow — hits that window every single time.
 *
 * So: probe the pane, and when we cannot DEMONSTRATE that a non-shell owns it, write nothing. A
 * probe that errors counts as "not demonstrated" — the asymmetry is deliberate, because an
 * unsynced session name is cosmetic while a destroyed launch is not.
 *
 * `current` is the name the node carries BEFORE this rename, and it is REQUIRED rather than
 * optional on purpose: a rename that changes nothing must reach the pane with nothing (see
 * `sessionNameUnchanged`), and an optional argument is one a call site forgets. Every caller
 * already holds the node it is renaming, so the type is what enforces the gate — neither
 * `Canvas.tsx` nor `TerminalNode.tsx` is unit-rendered in this repo, so the compiler is the only
 * reviewer that sees every site.
 *
 * Returns false both for "nothing to push" and for "the agent never took the pane"; the callers
 * are one-way mirrors and act on neither.
