/**
 * No user-visible string may call the local machine a Mac.
 *
 * Issue #563 was not one slip: ~30 strings across 15 files said "this Mac", and a grep is the only
 * thing that found them. The helper (`machineName.ts`) fixes the ones that existed; this test is
 * what stops the next string from bringing the assumption back — the same posture as
 * `fs-atomic.guard.test.ts`, and for the same reason: nothing else in the toolchain can see it,
 * because on the platform most of this was written on the sentence is true.
 *
 * COMMENTS ARE NOT SCANNED. They are not shown to anyone, they carry real history ("a Mac→SSH
 * node"), and rewriting them would bury the actual copy change in noise.
