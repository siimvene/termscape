/**

 *
 * The placeholder is minted at load time when the ref can't be read, and a save deliberately
 * emits a header-only ref for it — never a file — so a stale placeholder can't clobber a source
 * that might come back. Correct, but it also means a project whose file the user DELETED can
 * never write one again: nothing clears the flag for a local project, so it stays unreadable at
 * every later load. The tab goes inert (`tabClickAction` → 'ignore') while the sessions sidebar,
 * which knows nothing of `unavailable`, still switches to it — the asymmetry issue #385 reports.
 *
 * Opening the folder is a deliberate act, so it is the right moment to break the loop — but only
 * on evidence:
 *   - `absent`  → the file really is gone. Clear the flag so the next save recreates it; an empty
 *                 canvas is the truthful state, since that is what deleting the file left.
 *   - `present` → it reads again (restored, a git checkout). Rehydrate from disk rather than
 *                 clearing the flag, or an empty placeholder would be saved over real nodes.
 *   - `unreadable` → we cannot tell. Change nothing; the placeholder is exactly the right answer.
