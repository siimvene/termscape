// "Share with team" for an SSH project: hand the project, and the agent sessions running in it, to
// a hosted team that nodeterm-server runs on the SSH host itself. This module only SEQUENCES the
// steps; every effect (the ssh verbs, the dialog, the project store) is an injected dep, so each
// ordering rule below is pinned by a test rather than by a reading of the UI code.
//
// Three ordering invariants, each guarding a specific loss:
// 1. Nothing is ended before `bootstrap` succeeded. Until the server has adopted and shared the
//    project, the SSH sessions are the only place the work lives; a failure before that point must
//    leave every terminal running.
// 2. Nothing is resumed on the server before its `nodeterm-rmt` session was VERIFIED gone, so there
//    are never two processes on one conversation (two CLIs appending to one transcript). A kill
//    that could not be verified resumes nothing and reports the node as still on SSH.
// 3. After a successful bootstrap the SSH project is never reopened: the server is now the only
//    writer of the project file, and a desktop mirror write would race it. Every failure before
//    that point leaves the project as it was: once the share has marked (or closed) it, the
//    failure clears the mark and reopens it before it is reported, and says so when that undo
//    itself fails.
//
// The in-progress mark is set BEFORE the mirror is flushed, not with the close: a desktop save
// between the flush and the close could otherwise queue a throttled mirror write that lands on the
// host after the server adopted the file.
