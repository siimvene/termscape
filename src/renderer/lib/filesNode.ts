/**
 * The decisions a file-manager node makes, kept pure so they can be pressed in a test rather than
 * clicked in the app: which directory "up" is, what the breadcrumb shows, what a filter matches,
 * and what happens when you open a thing.
 *
 * Paths are `/`-separated absolutes throughout, remote ones included — the node talks to an
 * `FsApi`, which is the same shape for the local filesystem, an SSH project's host over the
 * ControlMaster, and a relay peer's core.
 *
 * **Windows is a known, INHERITED gap.** Every split here is on `/` alone, so `C:\\x\\y` reads as a
 * single segment: one breadcrumb, and `folderTitle` returning the whole path. This is shared with
 * `lib/explorerCreate.ts` (`parentDir`, `newEntryPath`, `ancestorDirs`), which the Explorer drawer
 * and the canvas "New file…" already run on, so a files node is not the thing that introduces it —
 * but Windows is being brought up as a first-class desktop target, and `quality-windows` now runs
 * on this branch. When it is closed, close it in ONE place for both: the path dialect belongs to
 * the filesystem-owning CORE, not the viewer, which is the rule `terminal/file-links.ts` already
 * implements and the one to copy.

/**
 * How a files node is re-pointed when the worktree it was living in is removed
 * (`resetDisplacedCwd`). It is caught by path wherever it sits, like an editor and unlike a
 * terminal, because it has no session to disturb — and it is re-pointed rather than flagged
 * `fileMissing`, because a directory can be re-pointed and a dead file cannot.
 *
 * `null` means LEAVE IT ALONE, and that is the interesting answer: with no fallback directory
 * there is nowhere honest to send it, and writing `undefined` is worse than doing nothing — the
 * node would lose the only thing it knows about itself. Left on the dead path, the parent-listing
 * probe usually says "Could not read this folder", which is the truth.
 *
 * Two honest caveats. The branch is near-unreachable in practice (a worktree binding cannot exist
 * without a project cwd, so a fallback almost always exists). And "usually": `git worktree remove`
 * deletes the worktree but not the now-empty `<repo>.worktrees/` container, so removing the LAST
 * one leaves the probe with an empty parent — `unknown`, which still renders as "empty". Doing
 * nothing is still better than writing a path we cannot justify.
 *
 * The title rides along while `titleAuto` holds. This is the one cwd write that does NOT go
 * through `navigate` — the only other place that pairs the two — so without it the node moves to
 * a new directory still wearing the removed worktree's name.

/**
 * What an EMPTY listing actually means.
 *
 * `FsApi` is fail-open by contract — `core/fs-ops.listDir` and `SshFs.listDir` both end
 * `catch { return [] }`, and the SSH IPC resolves `[]` even for a project whose ControlMaster is
 * down. So a `.catch` on `list()` fires only when the transport itself rejects, and a directory
 * that was deleted (a removed worktree, most obviously) comes back indistinguishable from one
 * that is genuinely empty. That is why the node's "could not read" state was unreachable.
 *
 * We do not ask `fs.exists`. It is `stat`-based, so it answers TRUE for a directory you can stat
 * but not `readdir`, and on SSH its `false` cannot separate "gone" from "the master died" — which
 * `SshFs.readTextChecked` singles out precisely so it can refuse to conflate them: *a failed read
 * is never evidence of absence*. Instead we ask the PARENT's listing, the same way
 * `SshProjectDialog` and `file-links.ts`'s `makeDirListingLookup` already answer this question.
 *
 * Four answers, and the last two are the point:
 *  - `missing` — the parent listed real entries and ours is not among them. Only this earns the
 *    error state.
 *  - `empty`   — the parent lists us, so the directory is there and simply has nothing in it.
 *    Root takes this too: it has no parent to ask and always exists.
 *  - `unreachable` — the parent came back empty or could not be read at all. It cannot be
 *    childless, since it contains us, so this says we could not see the filesystem. We still
 *    cannot tell "the whole subtree is gone" from "the connection is down", so the verdict names
 *    the doubt instead of guessing.
 *  - `unknown` — the path SHAPE means no parent listing could ever answer (see below). Genuinely
 *    no information, so the caller keeps saying "empty". Understating beats telling someone their
 *    folder was deleted because a network hiccup ate one `ls`.
 *
 * Matching is by NAME, not by `dir`, deliberately: a symlinked directory can list as a non-dir
 * entry depending on the leg, and mistaking one for "missing" is the false alarm this exists to
 * avoid.

  //    entry called `~`. So an empty remote HOME reported "Could not read this folder."
