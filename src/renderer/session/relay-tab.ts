// openRelayTab — turn an approved (or approving) relay connection into a project TAB.
//
// docs/remote-sessions.md, Stage 4 Task 6: a remote desktop is a client of the host's core, so it
// opens as an ordinary project tab (not a full-screen overlay). This is the join point that wires
// Task 5's `buildRelayApi` into the 4a session registry:
//   buildRelayApi(id) → createSession('relay', api, label) → a `projects` tab bound to it → active.
//
// TWO obligations this bootstrap owns (both would silently break the tab):
//  • Construction order (relay-api.ts gotcha 2): `buildRelayApi` is called FIRST — its
//    `RelayFrameTransport` registers the one-shot `onApproved` listener BEFORE we await `ready()`.
//    Build it after approval already fired and `ready()` stays pending forever.
//  • ready() can HANG (Task 5 review): `RelayFrameTransport.ready()` resolves only on `onApproved`
//    and NEVER rejects; a socket drop BEFORE the SAS is approved would leave the bootstrap awaiting
//    forever — a dead tab that never errors. So we RACE `ready()` against the connection's real
//    close signal (relayClient.onClosed) plus a timeout backstop, and reject on either.
