 * Issue #569 item 1 — the PTY-ready signal Canvas's armed-launch loop waits on.
 *
 * TerminalNode is impractical to mount in jsdom (xterm, a live PTY, dozens of stores), so the
 * exported CONTRACT is exercised directly and the publish/clear sites are pinned as source
 * tripwires — the same split `status-lifecycle.test.ts` uses.
