  // local directory's branch — or, far worse, strike the group out and unlock the stale-Unbind path,

  // Asking once per render is NOT enough to make the chip live: nothing re-renders a group frame
  // while the user works inside its terminals, so the dirty count would freeze at whatever it was
  // when the node last happened to render (verified — it sat at "0 changed" until the canvas was
  // clicked). Hence a tick. It owns no cache and no `git status` of its own: it just pokes the
  // store, whose throttle still decides whether a real read happens (so N frames don't mean N
  // reads, and a mid-window render still coalesces).
  //
  // A STALE worktree is polled too (that is how a group un-stales when the directory comes back —
  // e.g. the user restored it, or a git read failed transiently), and the poke carries the group id
  // so the store can flip staleness live instead of only at project load.
  //
  // `git status` is the full Source-Control read (ELEVEN git subprocesses — see git-service's
  // `status`), and it is per BOUND GROUP: nothing coalesces two worktrees, because they are
  // different paths. So the tick is gated twice and runs slowly:
  //  - **page visibility** — a hidden tab / minimized window polls nothing, and a
  //    `visibilitychange` back to visible pokes immediately so the chip is correct the moment it
  //    is seen again;
  //  - **viewport** — React Flow keeps every node MOUNTED regardless of the camera (we do not set
  //    `onlyRenderVisibleElements`), so without this a frame parked off-screen kept spawning git
  //    for a chip nobody could see. An IntersectionObserver against the document viewport is the
  //    same shape the WebGL budget uses; entering the viewport pokes at once.
  // The cadence is WORKTREE_STATUS_POLL_MS, deliberately far slower than the store's throttle
  // floor: the throttle exists so several pokes in one window cost one read, NOT as a target rate.
  // A dirty-file counter on a frame is ambient information (Source Control's own auto-fetch is
  // 180 s); an explicit poke — visibility, viewport entry, mount — still refreshes within the 4 s
  // floor, so the chip stays responsive to the things the user actually does.
  //

  // own mount/unmount lifecycle — no registry to leak.)
