// Source-text guards over the gates in `TerminalNode.tsx` that no test can reach behaviourally.
//
// Two families live here, for the same reason: neither `TerminalNode.tsx` nor `Canvas.tsx` is
// unit-rendered anywhere in this repo, so a wrong gate compiles, ships, and leaves the whole suite
// green. Both were verified by MUTATION — revert a gate and the matching test below fails.
//   1. the TWO TITLE gates (read vs write), below;
//   2. the CLAUDE-TRANSCRIPT gates (meter rehydration, find-bar transcript index, and the search
//      tooltip that describes them) at the bottom of this file.
//
// A guard over the TWO title gates, because the split is the whole point of the title lists.
//
// Reading a session's own name (`TITLE_READ_CAPABLE` — claude, grok, gemini) and PUSHING a name into
// a session (`RENAME_CAPABLE` — claude, grok) are different capabilities. Gating the poll on the
// write list costs gemini the title it names itself; gating a push on the read list types
// `/rename <name>` into a CLI that has no such command, in front of the user, on every rename.
//
// Neither `TerminalNode.tsx` nor `Canvas.tsx` is unit-rendered anywhere in this repo, so there is no
// behavioural test to catch either mistake — these are asserted over the SOURCE TEXT, the same
// technique `core/no-electron.test.ts` uses for the shell boundary. If a refactor moves a gate, the
// invariant is what matters: the poll reads, the push writes.

/**
 * The claude-transcript gates: `claudeTranscript` (`readsClaudeTranscript(agentId)`), NOT `showUsage`
 * (`hasUsage(agentId)`).
 *
 * `USAGE_CAPABLE` grew to claude + codex + gemini, so `showUsage` is now true for three agents while
 * only ONE of them has a claude transcript. Both readers behind these gates resolve a session id
 * through claude's `resolveTranscript`, whose cwd fallback answers *the newest claude transcript for
 * that cwd* — so on a codex or gemini node they resolve an UNRELATED claude session and then meter
 * it, and search it, under this node's session id. That was this branch's own Critical fix, and
 * reverting either gate to `showUsage` left the full suite green: nothing in this repo renders
 * `TerminalNode`, so this file is the only thing standing between the bug and a re-landing.
 *
 * Asserted per LINE rather than with `toContain` over a 6000-line file: a whole-file `toContain`
 * failure dumps the file as its diff, and a per-line assertion names the site instead.
