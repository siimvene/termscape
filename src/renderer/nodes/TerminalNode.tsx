 * every glyph is resampled (see `DeviceCell` in the shared layer). Fractional by nature

 * PITCH, never the sampled extent.
 *
 * **It is read RAW, and the dpr rebuild does not change that.** A tie-break against the CSS cell
 * scaled by `window.devicePixelRatio` was tried here (to guard the re-register that follows a
 * display change against a measurement taken on the display we left) and reverted, for reasons
 * worth keeping so it is not tried a third time:
 *  - There is no staleness window to guard. `CoreBrowserService.dpr` is a live getter over
 *    `window.devicePixelRatio` — nothing is cached — and the generation bump runs `teardownGlyph()`
 *    BEFORE it raises the epoch, which restores a fresh `DomRenderer` whose constructor recomputes
 *    the dimensions against that live dpr. By the time `setupGlyph` reads it, `device.cell` is the
 *    NEW display's.
 *  - `css × dpr` does not reproduce it anyway. xterm rounds the CSS canvas
 *    (`css.canvas.width = round(device.cell.width * cols / dpr)`) and divides that by `cols`, so
 *    the CSS cell carries a per-terminal residual — the same rounding `addon.ts` documents and
 *    reproduces.
 *  - Which made the reading GEOMETRY-dependent: two terminals with the same font on one retina
 *    display returned different "device cells", tripping `warnOnCellDrift`'s 0.01 threshold on an
 *    ordinary multi-terminal canvas. That is the line the device checklist arms the tester with,
 *    so the guard's only lasting effect would have been false positives on the platform being
 *    promoted.

  // NEW one. A font change reaches us as a `glyphEpoch` bump raised synchronously from the
  // generation notification, i.e. BEFORE that commit; re-registering there would pin the grid to
  // the old cell size forever (a grid's cell size cannot be changed after `register`). The font
  // settings are in the deps as well as the epoch, so the re-setup still lands after the options
  // even if the two ever arrive in separate renders. Do not move this effect above the one above.

  // It also owns every state in which this node must not be on the shared canvas although it is
  // mounted — `glyphOff` names them all (collapsed, ⌘M, stacked over another node, being dragged)
  // and the ref beside it carries the same answer to `setupGlyph`'s own gate. Each drops the grid
  // and re-registers on the way back, through the SAME teardown/setup machinery that collapse and
  // ⌘M have always used: `teardownGlyph` clears `glyphMounted` (so `term-node--glyphgrid` comes off
  // the node root) and removes `glyphgrid-mode` from the xterm element, which is exactly what makes
  // the body opaque and the DOM rows visible again. Nothing here is a special case for stacking.
  //
  // ORDERING, the second time: `glyphOff` is built from a RENDER-TIME read of the opaque set, which
  // Canvas stores during its own render — i.e. before this component rendered at all. So on the
  // commit that ends a drag, `dragging: false` and the post-drop overlap answer arrive TOGETHER,
  // and this effect makes one decision instead of attaching a glyph and tearing it down again a
  // pass later. Do not "simplify" that read into state; state is exactly what lagged.
  //
  // `dragging` (this node's own prop) is kept alongside because it flips synchronously at gesture
  // start and needs nobody else. Children of a dragged GROUP frame never get it — React Flow's

            (that is the precondition for appearing); it exists for the frame between coming into

            …with ONE case where it is seen head-on, and it is deliberate: a COLLAPSED node. The
            body is `display: none` while collapsed, so the observed element reports
            not-intersecting and a collapsed terminal is disposed after the window even though its
            header sits in plain view. Expanding revives it — the display flip changes the
            intersection, the observer fires, and the node reattaches. Collapsed is exactly the
            state in which nobody is reading this terminal's output, which is why the WebGL budget
            has always treated it as hidden too; this feature only agrees with it. Not a bug. */}
