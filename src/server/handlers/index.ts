  // The Server Edition answers "no shared identity", so every Codex node here launches the bare
  // `codex` it always did — a working node with its own app-server, just without the shared one.
  //
  // The secret question that used to block this is ANSWERED: src/server/index.ts arms
  // `hookServer.setNodeAuthSecret(await loadOrCreateNodeAuthSecret())` at boot, which on a headless
  // host is raw 0600 bytes in the data dir — a decision taken explicitly, not quietly (see
  // src/core/agents/node-auth-secret.ts). As of S6 PR 5 the same boot path also calls
  // `setCodexThreadIdentityAuthSecret(secret)`, so a MANAGED Codex account's thread→node→account
  // ownership records sign and verify on this headless host instead of throwing "identity
  // authentication is unavailable" (the carried PR-2 obligation). What stays deliberately absent
  // here is the shared-app-server plumbing (`refreshCodexIdentityCaps()` + the two
  // `setCodexThread*Handler` registrations src/main/index.ts makes): the Server Edition answers "no
  // shared identity" so its Codex nodes launch the bare `codex` — a working node with its own
  // app-server, just without the shared one. Arming the record secret is orthogonal to that
  // degrade: it never launches an app-server, it only lets the record layer sign.

  // No `installSkill`: canvas control is not wired on this edition (its hook server answers
  // `control unavailable` by name), so a per-account skill file would point at nothing.
  // No `remote`: the Server Edition has no SSH-project manager, so an `AccountCtx` carrying a
