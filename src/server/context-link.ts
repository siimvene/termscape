// Context Link for the Server Edition — the piece the desktop gets from its renderer.
//
// The feature itself is entirely in core (src/core/context-link.ts): it builds the per-node link
// documents, installs the shim + skill + instruction blocks, and answers reads on the hook
// server's /context-link/ route. All of it is shell-agnostic, and every path it writes is derived
// from `platform().userDataDir` — which here IS the server's dataDir. What was missing server-side
// is the one thing that came from the desktop renderer: somebody to say WHICH nodes are linked.
// Without that push the map stays empty, no contextLinkHandler is ever registered, and the route
// answers "Context link is unavailable in this session."
//
// On the desktop the canvas is the authority: React Flow holds the live edges. Headless there is
// no focused canvas — there may be no browser attached at all while the agents keep working — so
// the authority is the persisted project file instead. `bridges[]` in `.nodeterm/project.json` is
// the same edge set the renderer would have pushed, so we derive the map from every persisted
// canvas and get a link map that is correct with zero tabs open.
