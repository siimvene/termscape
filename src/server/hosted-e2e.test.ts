// The hosted team relay, end to end, on a REAL `startServer` boot (headless, no hooks, temp data dir).
//
// Every piece below has its own unit suite; this one proves they COMPOSE: the admin socket's `team`
// verbs drive the same service the relay listeners belong to, the access policy sees the node and
// project ids the real workspace store answers, the relay peer's requests reach the real platform
// handlers, and a viewer's terminal is the owner's live one. The flow:
//   (the canvas is seeded through a WorkspaceStore before boot: a relay peer cannot save the host's
//   workspace) team init → add-owner → share → the owner joins (auto-approved) and opens a terminal → a guest
//   knocks and waits → the owner approves it as a viewer → the viewer joins the owner's live
//   session, cannot start one, cannot write a file, cannot read the enclosing repository through git
//   → `team status` lists it as a connected viewer → the canvas authority (no browser attached):
//   the owner's canvas ops are written to the shared project's file by this core, the viewer hears
//   them and cannot cast one, an outside edit of the file reaches the owner as ops → `team unshare`
//   silences the viewer's terminal → a restart on the same data dir keeps every edit.
// A second test starts from a server with no team at all and drives `team bootstrap`, the one verb
// the desktop's "Share with team" calls: it sets up the team, the owner, an adopted folder and its
// share → the owner joins with no SAS on either side → a re-run changes nothing and keeps the code →
// a second folder's share reaches the connected owner live (`relay:hosted:shared-changed`) → so does
// its `team unshare`.
//
// What is real and what is not:
//  - REAL: startServer and every core service it boots, the admin unix socket and its client, the
//    hosted service, the relay E2EE handshake and trust gates on both ends (core `connectRelayClient`
//    is the desktop joiner's own connector), the access policy, WorkspaceStore, PtyManager.
//  - FAKE: the relay server (an in-process transport pair per listener, `relayTestTransport`), the
//    host-token API (`relayTestFetch`), and `node-pty` (a recording fake — no process is spawned).
//    The server's terminals are plain shells here (settings.json `tmuxEnabled: false`), so the test
//    runs the same with or without tmux on the machine and leaves NO tmux session anywhere: there is
//    nothing to kill afterwards, and it never touches a tmux server (the vitest sandbox re-points
//    TMUX_TMPDIR regardless). A viewer's join is the in-process co-attach either way — the branch a
//    tmux-backed session takes too once its owner is attached.
//
// No sleeps: every step waits on an event it is owed (a transport the scheduler opened, a frame, an
// approval, pty bytes). `step()` puts a deadline on each wait ONLY so that a hang fails with that
// step's name instead of the test timeout; nothing ever waits on the clock to succeed. The one wait
// that polls is the project file (`projectFileWhen`): the authority's flush is a disk write, and no
// client is sent an event for it. It polls every 100 ms under a step deadline.
//
// One data dir per test. The per-process memos hosted-boot.test.ts warns about (the context-link
// dir, the hook endpoint file) are re-derived by every boot (`initContextLink`) and dropped by every
// close (`hookServer.stop()`), so a later test's boot does not write into an earlier test's removed
// dir. The first test's restart boots a second server on the SAME data dir.
