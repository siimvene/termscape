// Authenticated WebSocket endpoint for the Server Edition.
//
// Attaches a `WebSocketServer({ noServer: true })` to an existing http.Server and
// handles the `upgrade` event ONLY for path `/ws`. The upgrade is gated by the
// session cookie AND (when an Origin header is present) an Origin/Host same-host
// check that blocks cross-site WebSocket hijacking — native clients (curl/ws)
// without an Origin still pass the gate but must present a valid cookie.
//
// Once connected, each socket attaches to the ServerPlatform as one UI: text
// frames are parsed as RPC (req → dispatch → response; cast → cast; anything else
// ignored), and the platform pushes JSON events / binary pty frames back through
// the sink. Binary client→server frames are ignored in Phase 2 (pty input rides
// JSON casts). See task-5-brief.md.

 * rather than a permanent fixture, slow enough to survive a stalled tab or a brief network hiccup
 * (a live browser answers a ping from the protocol layer, with no page JS involved) and to stay
 * well inside the ~60 s idle timeout of common reverse proxies, which the ping traffic also keeps

/**
 * Largest client→server frame the receiver will accept (8 MiB). `ws` defaults to 100 MiB, which is
 * a remote DoS on a process that is shared by every user of the box: one client holding the single
 * Server Edition password can loop 100 MB frames and OOM the server, taking down everyone's ptys,
 * the hook server and the workspace store. The receiver drops an oversized frame with close code
 * 1009 before it ever reaches dispatch, so nothing buffers it.
 *
 * Why 8 MiB — what actually rides this socket, client→server:
 *   - `pty:write` casts: keystrokes and clipboard pastes (kilobytes; a giant paste is not a thing
 *     a terminal survives anyway),
 *   - presence casts: cursor points, and chat/name/focus strings the hub itself caps at 200 / 32 /
 *     128 code points,
 *   - RPC requests, of which the biggest by far is `fs:write` — an editor node saving its file,
 *     JSON-escaped. 8 MiB comfortably covers any text file a Monaco editor is usable on (a 1 MB
 *     source file is already an outlier, and JSON escaping roughly doubles it in the worst case),
 *     plus `workspace:save` (a whole canvas: nodes + sticky text, tens of KB).
 * That leaves ~an order of magnitude of headroom over the largest legitimate frame while cutting
 * the worst case a single frame can cost the process by ~12×.
