/**
 * The Server Edition's `settings` verb (@shared/settings-verb): reads work, changes are refused by
 * name.
 *
 * WHY `--set` IS REFUSED HERE. On the desktop every change is a dialog, and the user's click is the
 * consent. This edition's canvas control is HEADLESS — its admission is verified node identity plus
 * process-local creator ownership (`HeadlessNodeFactory`), and nothing on the path ever asks a
 * person. The operator's opt-in (`NODETERM_SERVER_CANVAS_CONTROL=1`, #537) decides that agents may
 * drive the canvas at all; it is not a statement about any particular setting, and treating it as
 * standing consent to grant capabilities would be exactly the waiver `settings` refuses on the
 * desktop. So a change is refused with a permanent, named reason, and the agent is told to ask the
 * user to change it in Settings.
 *
 * `--get` answers from the same stores the delivery gate reads — the capability view is
 * `workspaceStore.capabilityProjectFor`, i.e. the file flag plus this machine's recorded answer — so
 * a read can never say "on" where a delivery would be refused. `--project` is limited to the
 * caller's OWN project: this edition keeps no `open-project` grant ledger that main's
 * `gateProjectTarget` could consult, and a read of another project's switch is not worth inventing
 * one for.
