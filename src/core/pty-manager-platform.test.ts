  // `on` and `onWithSender` COMPOSE on the same channel — on BOTH shells. Electron registers two
  // separate `ipcMain.on`s; ServerPlatform keeps one ordered registry and invokes every entry. So
  // a merge that resurrects the old `platform().on(IPC.ptyWrite, …)` line NEXT TO the sender-aware
  // one does not error, does not typecheck-fail, and does not fail any behavioural test (they all
  // invoke the sender map, and the fake keeps the two maps apart) — it just runs the handler TWICE:
  // every keystroke, every paste, every user, doubled into the pty (`lls s`). Resize and flow are
  // barely better: a doubled resize is a second full-pane tmux redraw, a doubled flow cast
  // double-counts the pause the client owes.
  //
  // Hence this: the four migrated channels must have NO plain listener at all. If you are here
  // because this went red, you added a second registration for a channel that already has a
  // sender-aware one — delete it, don't relax the assertion.
