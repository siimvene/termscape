/**
 * The ONE place this module decides what a failed GitHub call means.
 *
 * The distinction that matters to a user is "you are signed out" against "GitHub could not be
 * asked". Only the first is fixed by signing in, and saying it for the second sends the user to
 * re-authenticate an account that is fine — while the real cause (a rate limit, an outage, a
 * dropped network) goes unnamed. So `unauthorized` is reserved for an answer GitHub actually gave
 * about the credential: a 401, or a 403 that is not a rate limit. Everything that merely failed to
 * produce an answer is `unreachable` or `rate-limited`, and must never be reported as signed out.
 *
 * It reads the error's SHAPE (`code`, `status`, `retryAt`) rather than its class, so an error that
 * lost its prototype on the way (a structured clone, a re-thrown copy) still classifies the same.
