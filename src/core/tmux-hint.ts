 * WHY IT IS THE LAST RESORT and not the first (`findTmux` appends it after every system path):
 * a tmux CLIENT talks to a tmux SERVER that may already be running on this machine — started by
 * whatever tmux the user has installed, and outliving the app by design. Preferring our own binary
 * would pair a client we chose with a server we did not, which upstream rejects outright when the
 * protocol differs ("server version is too old"). System-first means every user who already has
 * tmux sees literally zero change in behavior; the bundled copy exists solely for the population
 * that has none, where there is no server to be incompatible with.
 *
 * `resourcesPath` is Electron's `process.resourcesPath`, injected through CorePlatform — src/core
 * must stay Electron-free (see no-electron.test.ts), and the Server Edition supplies neither it nor
 * a repo root, so this correctly returns null there (Linux keeps system-tmux-only).
