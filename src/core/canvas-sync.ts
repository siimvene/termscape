// Canvas sync — the reflector.
//
// Every attached client (an Electron renderer, a Server-Edition browser tab) casts its LOCAL node
// mutations on `canvas:mut`. This service stamps each one with a monotone `seq` and sends it back
// out on the same channel to EVERY attached client, so all clients converge on the same node set —
// a teammate's cursor never hovers over stale geometry, and a client whose canvas still held a node
// someone else deleted can no longer write it back on the next whole-file workspace.save.
//
// THE `seq` IS THE POINT, and it is the one piece of state here. Without a total order, two clients
// that edit the same node while each other's mutation is in flight apply them in OPPOSITE orders
// and diverge permanently — see the derivation in src/shared/canvas-order.ts, which is the client
// half of this contract. `seq` is server-authoritative: whatever the client put there is
// overwritten at ingest, so a client cannot forge its way to the front of the order.
//
// IT ECHOES TO THE SENDER TOO — that is deliberate, and it replaced the earlier sender-suppression.
// A sender's own echo is its ACK: it is the only way it learns where its edit landed in the total
// order, which is what lets it decide whether a peer's mutation supersedes its own optimistic
// state. The client drops the echo instead of re-applying it (canvas-order rule 1), so it does not
// fight its own optimistic state, and the publisher's `adopt` guard still means nothing is
// re-published: no loop.
//
// Beyond `seq` it is a pipe, not a store: it holds NO canvas state, applies no policy, and persists
// nothing. The canvas itself stays where it has always been — React Flow in each renderer — and the
// disk write stays with WorkspaceStore.
//
// NOT RATE-LIMITED, deliberately — unlike presence (see PRESENCE_RATE_BUDGETS). A presence cast is
// a SAMPLED signal whose loss is self-correcting: the next cursor frame carries the current
// position. A mutation is an EDGE: nothing supersedes it and nothing re-announces it, so a dropped
// one is LOST STATE — a node that never appears on a peer's canvas, or a delete that never lands
// (and then gets written back to disk by that peer's next save, which is the very bug Stage 3
// exists to fix). Legitimate traffic is also burstier than any bucket sized for it would survive:
// a drag emits at 20 Hz, and a bulk delete emits N mutations in ONE tick. What IS bounded is the
// PAYLOAD (see isCanvasMutation): an oversized or malformed mutation is refused at ingest, so a
// hostile cast cannot amplify into every peer's socket or wedge a peer's React Flow. If a budget
// is ever needed here, it must queue — never drop.
//
// No electron, no ws, no disk (see no-electron.test.ts).
