/**
 * Where `out/session-host/host.cjs` lives, in dev vs a packaged build.
 *
 * - Packaged: inside the asar, at `<appPath>/out/session-host/host.cjs`. `build.files` is
 *   `["out/**", "package.json"]`, so the bundle is already carried there by the ordinary packaging
 *   rules — nothing has to copy it anywhere.
 *
 *   This is deliberately NOT `<resourcesPath>/session-host` via `extraResources`, which is what the
 *   original comment here described (an `extraResources` entry that was never actually added). A
 *   host placed there cannot RUN: Electron patches `Module._nodeModulePaths` so a script under
 *   `resourcesPath` may only resolve from paths under `resourcesPath`, and the search list for
 *   `<resourcesPath>/session-host` is just
 *
 *       <resourcesPath>/session-host/node_modules
 *       <resourcesPath>/node_modules
 *
 *   neither of which holds `node-pty` — which the bundle needs, since `host:build` marks it
 *   `--external`. From inside the asar the search list instead reaches
 *   `<resourcesPath>/app.asar/node_modules`, where electron-builder's unpacked-native redirect
 *   makes `node-pty` resolve. Measured on a packaged Windows build; see the tests.
 *
 * - Dev (`electron-vite dev`): `app.getAppPath()` IS the repo root, so the same candidate answers
 *   both. `repoRoot` (`process.cwd()`) stays as a fallback for shells that supply no app path.

 *
 * `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1` is what makes this work when `process.execPath` is the Electron
 * binary itself (a packaged app has no separate `node` executable to shell out to) — Electron
 * treats that env var as "run this as a plain Node process, skip the Chromium/BrowserWindow

 * staged copy outside the install directory (`session-host-runtime.ts`), and only lands here when
 * staging failed or the staged copy could not start.
 *
 * The separate image name makes the background host identifiable, but does NOT isolate it from
 * updates: it still maps the installed Electron image and DLLs. NSIS can find processes by path
 * as well as name. The installer preflight must refuse while this host (or the app) is running;
 * it must never kill the host implicitly, because doing so ends every preserved session (#829).
 * The link must sit beside Electron's sibling DLLs, locales/ and resources/ to run.
 *
 * Identity is compared with BIGINT stats. An NTFS file id is 64-bit and routinely exceeds
 * `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`, so the default numeric `ino` can report two different files as the
 * same one — which here would mean happily launching a stale or unrelated binary. A zero id is
 * treated as "cannot prove identity" and re-links rather than trusting it.
 *
 * Every failure — a read-only install dir, a filesystem without hard links, a directory squatting
 * the name, a link that cannot be removed — returns `execPath`, which is exactly today's behaviour.
 * The installer preflight checks both names, including this fallback.
