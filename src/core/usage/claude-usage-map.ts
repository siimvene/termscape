// Pure mapping of Anthropic's OAuth usage payload into our normalized limit list.
// Lives in core (no electron, no fs, no fetch) so both shells share it and it stays unit-tested;
// the impure token/keychain/HTTP work stays in the shell (main/claude-usage.ts).
//
// The payload carries the same facts twice. The legacy shape is a set of fixed top-level
// windows (`five_hour`, `seven_day`, and the now-always-null `seven_day_opus` /
// `seven_day_sonnet` / …). The current shape is a generic `limits[]` array where a per-model
// quota is an ordinary entry carrying `scope.model.display_name`. We prefer `limits[]` and
// treat the model name as DATA, never as a field name — that is the whole point of the new
// contract: when the next model ships, its limit arrives as another array entry and this file
// does not change. Binding a `fableWeekly` slot (or a `seven_day_fable` field) would recreate
// the exact rigidity Anthropic just moved away from.
