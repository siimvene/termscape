// Claude subscription usage for a REMOTE (SSH project) account, read over that project's
// ControlMaster. v1 deliberately had none of this ("remote accounts are excluded"), so a user
// whose Claude runs on a server saw an empty pill while the host had perfectly good numbers.
//
// **The token never leaves the host.** The desktop could `cat` the remote `.credentials.json`
// and call the API itself — it already reads remote transcripts over the same master — but a
// bearer token pulled off a (possibly shared) server into another machine's memory is a bigger
// surface than any transcript read, and it buys nothing: the host can make the request itself.
// So the remote shell reads its own credential file and curls the endpoint; we only ever see
// the JSON answer. Two consequences the command below is built around:
//   - the token must not appear in the remote **argv** (`ps` is readable by other users on a
//     shared host), which is why it is piped into `curl --config -` instead of `-H`;
//   - the reply is marker-delimited, so shell/profile noise can never be parsed as usage
//     (same lesson as `claude-version-probe`).
//
// curl is a hard requirement, not a fallback-to-wget: the canvas-control and context-link shims
// already require it on every host, and wget would put the token back on the command line.
