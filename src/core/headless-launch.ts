// The headless launcher (#925): start a node's session with no viewer and deliver its launch
// command by the rule a mounted terminal's automatic launch writer applies — settle a fresh shell,
// then either trust it (`trustsFreshShell`: a fresh plain shell or session-host session, whose
// probe is useless or unreliable) or prove a shell owns the pane, then the echo-verified writer
// (@shared/command-delivery). The desktop runs it for canvas-control `--run-now` / `run`; the
// Server Edition runs it for every immediate open.
//
// Never a blind paste: zsh's rc/ZLE setup FLUSHES the tty (#556) and a canonical-mode line is cut
// at the tty's cap (#706). A tmux paste is not immune to either, which is why the desktop rule
// "launches use the echo-verified writer, not sendText" now covers this path too.

 * The desktop's `pty.launchHeadless` request, as main runs it: the renderer sends only
 * `{ ptyOptions, command }`, and the desktop always releases its synthetic client, so it always
 * requires a persistent backend. Whatever else the wire carries is overwritten here.
 *
 * `sshRemote` is stripped: this path never spawns over a ControlMaster. `viewerId` is stripped: a
 * headless start is the connection's PRIMARY view, and `releaseHeadless` detaches `(0, PRIMARY)`,
 * so a create under a viewer id would subscribe `(0, viewer)` and leave client 0 attached forever.
 * `clearEnv` is stripped: it is a one-shot "Restart on subscription" recycle flag, never a launch
 * option. `requireRemote` is KEPT as sent. The primary fence is the renderer's: `startHeadless` refuses an SSH node before any claim
 * (`remote-unsupported`), so none should arrive here. `requireRemote` — which the renderer's
 * `headlessPtyOptions` sets for an SSH-project node — is core's belt behind that fence: it makes
 * `spawnNew` refuse (`unavailable:'ssh'` → `spawn-failed`), where clearing it with `sshRemote`
 * would start a LOCAL `nt-<id>` wearing the remote node's identity and type its launch there
 * (CLAUDE.md, "A remote node is NEVER spawned locally").
