// Dial the ControlMasters of OPEN SSH projects shortly after boot, so the first switch to one is
// already warm.
//
// WHY (measured, 2026-09-15, real sshd behind a 25 ms one-way delay proxy = 50 ms RTT). A project's
// master is established only when the user first switches to it, so the first visit of every app
// run pays the cold establish (TCP + KEX + auth until `-O check` answers: 0.44 s) and then the
// connect's remote setup chain (~23 serialized ssh exec children: 3.54 s) before a single terminal
// can attach. Both are wall-clock the user spends looking at blank panes. Neither depends on the
// user having switched — so do them while nobody is waiting.
//
// Three properties this planner exists to guarantee, all of them things that were easy to get
// wrong by hand:
//  - CLOSED projects are never dialed. `closeProject` is non-destructive and deliberately leaves
//    the host's sessions running; a closed tab is the user saying "not now", and waking an SSH
//    login (and possibly a passphrase prompt) for it is worse than a slow first switch.
//  - A project that is already connected, or already being connected, is never re-dialed. The
//    pre-warm must never be the thing that competes with the user's own connect.
//  - One host at a time. Bursting every master at once is the failure mode the `SshChildGate`
//    exists for, one level up: the gate caps exec children PER control path, so N simultaneous
//    fresh masters to N hosts are N independent budgets and nothing paces the logins themselves.
