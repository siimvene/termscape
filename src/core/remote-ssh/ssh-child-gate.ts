// A per-ControlMaster ceiling on how many ssh EXEC children may be in flight at once.
//
// WHY (measured against a real sshd, 2026-09-14). Every non-pty ssh command an SSH project runs is
// an exec child multiplexed over that project's one ControlMaster, and a stock sshd allows
// `MaxSessions 10` channels on one connection. A connect fans out ~23 hook-install round trips plus
// four fire-and-forget chains, a Source Control refresh is 13 concurrent `git` children, and every
// live remote terminal is already holding one of those channels for its whole life. When the burst
// overruns the limit each excess child is told `Session open refused by peer`, falls back to
// becoming a master, cannot bind the socket the live master owns (`ControlSocket … already exists,
// disabling multiplexing`) and performs a FULL TCP+KEX+auth login.
//
// A flood of simultaneous logins then trips the host's `MaxStartups`, and sshd resets the losers —
// `kex_exchange_identification: read: Connection reset by peer`. That is the expensive outcome: a
// reset is not a slow command, it is a FAILED one, and in the app it becomes a dropped terminal and
// the reconnect backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 15s).
//
// Lab: one switch to a 10-terminal project with a 20-probe burst, MaxSessions 10, 20 ms RTT.
//   ungated (4 runs): 4, 6, 6, 8 connections RESET; once a pane never painted at all (9/10)
//   gated at 6 (3 runs): 0, 0, 0 resets; every pane painted
// Wall time is a wash (0.62–1.71 s gated, 0.68–1.14 s ungated) — the gate paces logins rather than
// preventing them once the terminals alone fill the host's limit. What it removes is the resets.
//
// Two things it deliberately does NOT gate:
//  - **Mux CONTROL commands** (`ssh -O check/exit/forward/cancel`). They talk to the master's
//    control socket instead of opening a session channel, so they cost the host nothing and cannot
//    be refused for a channel limit — and queueing the 45 s watchdog's `-O check` behind six 5 MB
//    transcript reads would make the health probe report on a connection it never looked at.
//  - **The terminals themselves.** A pty is spawned through node-pty, not through this runner, so
//    a terminal never waits on a queue for a screen the user is looking at.
//
// The ceiling is per CONTROL PATH because that is what a `MaxSessions` limit is scoped to: one
// connection. Two SSH projects on the same host have two masters and two independent budgets.

/** Concurrent exec children allowed per ControlMaster. Deliberately below a stock `MaxSessions 10`
