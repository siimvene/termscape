 *
 * THE TEXT IS NOT IN THIS ARGV. It rides the ssh child's STDIN into `tmux load-buffer -b … -`.
 * Two reasons, and both of them bit the previous version:
 *
 *  - ARG_MAX. `set-buffer -- "$text"` / `send-keys -l -- '<text>'` puts the whole payload in one
 *    argument, and a single argument is capped at MAX_ARG_STRLEN (128 KB). Measured locally: a
 *    300 KB payload dies with "Argument list too long"; the same payload through `load-buffer -`
 *    lands intact. A scrollback paste or a long note push is not a hypothetical size.
 *  - This repo's standing rule: no payload on a command line. It also retires the `posixQuote`
 *    of an attacker-influenced body into a remote shell line entirely — there is nothing left to
 *    quote.
 *
 * FRAMING is tmux's job now, not ours. See `localTmuxPasteArgs` for the whole measurement: the
 * old `#{bracket_paste_flag}` conditional needed tmux 3.7 on the REMOTE host and silently
 * degraded to a raw-newline mangle on every older one, while `paste-buffer -p` has consulted the
 * pane's real bracketed-paste state since tmux 1.7 (2012). The remote host's tmux version stops
 * being something this feature depends on.
 *
 * `sanitizePasteText` still runs — at the CALLER (`PtyManager.sendText`), once, for both paths,
 * on the bytes that go down stdin. tmux inserting the frame does not make a payload-supplied
 * `ESC[201~` harmless: it would still close the frame early and turn the rest into key input.
 *
 * The `#{pane_in_mode}` format and the inner `send-keys` command string are single-quoted so the
 * remote SHELL passes them through verbatim — `#…` at the start of a word is a comment to sh, and
 * the inner command is one tmux argument. `sessionId` is spliced unquoted, exactly as every
 * sibling builder here does, and that is safe only because `sessionName()` sanitises to
