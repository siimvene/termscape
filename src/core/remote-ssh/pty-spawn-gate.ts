// A per-ControlMaster ceiling on how many REMOTE pty spawns may be in flight at once.
//
// WHY (measured on the reporting host, 2026-09-15). A remote terminal is `ssh -t … tmux
// new-session -A …` spawned through node-pty, which deliberately does NOT go through the
// `SshChildGate` — "a pty is never queued for a screen the user is looking at" (see
// ssh-child-gate.ts). That is right for a handful of terminals and wrong for a canvas: a project
// switch mounts every node in the SAME tick, so a 108-node project opened 107 ssh clients at once
// on one multiplexed connection. sshd logged **757 `Accepted publickey` full logins** in the seven
// minutes around it, against the ~0 a healthy ControlMaster produces — each channel past the
// host's `MaxSessions` is refused, falls back to becoming a master, cannot bind the socket the
// live master owns, and performs a complete TCP+KEX+auth login instead.
//
// The cost is not the logins. It is that under that pressure every OTHER read on the connection
// times out, including the "does my session already exist?" probe — whose fail-safe answers
// "exists", so `new-session -A` creates an empty session and the node never cold-restores. 66 of
// those 107 sessions ended at a bare shell with the user's conversation stranded on disk.
//
// So the terminals are paced now, and the ONE thing that makes that acceptable is that a slot is
// held only until the session starts painting — not for the terminal's life:
//
//  - a slot is released on the pty's FIRST OUTPUT, which for a warm attach is one round trip
//    (measured: 18 parallel warm attaches at 50 ms RTT painted in a median of 0.16 s);
//  - and unconditionally after `REMOTE_PTY_SPAWN_SETTLE_MS`, because a pty that never produces a
//    byte must not be able to wedge the queue behind it. A gate that can hang is worse than no
//    gate at all — the failure it is preventing is at least visible.
//
// LOCAL terminals are not gated at all: there is no connection to overrun, and node-pty spawns
// cost nothing a queue would save.

/** Remote pty spawns allowed in flight per ControlMaster. Deliberately small: each one is an ssh
 *  channel that will be held for the terminal's whole life, so the burst is the only thing worth
