/**
 * POSIX-sh prelude prepended to every managed hook script.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS: with the shared app-server, the shell a Codex TOOL runs in is spawned by that
 * server, not by the TUI client NodeTerm launched. It therefore inherits `CODEX_THREAD_ID` but
 * none of the `NODETERM_*` env we set on the pane — so the hook it runs has no idea which canvas
 * node it belongs to, and the node's badge/status would simply never move. This recovers the node
 * binding from the thread id.
 *
 * The mapping file is parsed as DATA (`sed`), never sourced as shell code, and both recovered
 * fields are re-validated before they are exported. The record itself is HMAC-signed by
 * `codex-identity-proxy.ts`; this prelude cannot verify that signature (no key in an agent's
 * shell), which is why the charset re-validation below is not redundant.
 *
 * ACCOUNT SCOPING (S6): a SYSTEM record lives at the bare root (`<root>/<threadId>`) and a MANAGED
 * record under `<root>/<accountId>/<threadId>`. This prelude reads `NODETERM_CODEX_ACCOUNT_ID` from
 * the daemon's env to pick the scope:
 *   - a known, safe account id ⇒ read ONLY that account's record, and require the record's
 *     `accountId=` line to agree with the daemon scope;
 *   - an EMPTY account id (the classic shared tool shell that knows only a bare thread id) ⇒ scan
 *     EVERY scope (bare-root system + each managed subdir) and bind ONLY when exactly one candidate
 *     matches (`nt_codex_matches -eq 1`). Two accounts holding the same thread id ⇒ ambiguous ⇒
 *     change nothing (Property 3 / Constraint 8, the same fail-closed posture as the TypeScript
 *     `resolveCodexThreadNodeIdentity`).
 *
 * WHAT IT EXPORTS IS WHAT THE RECORD SAYS — it does not decide. `NODETERM_AGENT_ID` and
 * `NODETERM_CANVAS_CONTROL` used to be constants here (`codex`, granted), and both are facts only
 * `hookServer.buildPtyEnv` knows: it labels the node with its OWN agent id, which for a custom
 * agent inheriting the codex harness is `custom:<uuid>`, and it gates the grant on
 * `canControlCanvas`. Asserting them here mislabelled every such node, and asserted a grant that
 * agrees with the pane today only because `SHARED_IDENTITY_CAPABLE ⊆ CANVAS_CONTROL_CAPABLE` — a
 * coincidence that list's own comment invites the next shared-identity agent to break. So the pair
 * is recorded at bind time and read back here. A PRE-AGENT record (written before those fields
 * existed) carries neither and means `codex` with the grant, which is precisely what it meant when
 * it was written; a record that names an agent is exported as it stands, grant included, and never
 * falls back to the guess.
 *
 * Inert for every other agent: without `CODEX_THREAD_ID` the whole block is skipped. A machine with
 * no managed accounts has no subdirs, so the scan reduces to the one bare-root read S4 did — the
 * legacy layout keeps resolving byte-for-byte (Constraint 12).
 *
 * Deliberately free of Node/Electron imports beyond the path it is given: the generated-script
 * cores are shared by the desktop and the Server Edition.

/**
 * PROBE U5 (Codex 0.146.0, 2026-08-19 — docs/superpowers/probes/2026-08-codex-tool-shell-env.md):
 * a shared `app-server`-spawned tool shell carries `CODEX_THREAD_ID` (measured — a fresh id per
 * thread) and NOT the per-pane `NODETERM_*` (the tool shell forks from the shared daemon, not the
 * connecting client; corroborated by the deployed S4 resolver that depends on exactly this). The
 * premise HOLDS, so the account-scoped scan below is warranted. Caveat: an in-process app-server
 * (`codex exec`) leaks `NODETERM_*`, but the outer `[ -z "$NODETERM_NODE_ID" ]` guard no-ops there.
 *
 * @param identityRoot absolute path of the thread → node record directory
 *   (`codexThreadIdentityRoot()`, i.e. under `CorePlatform.userDataDir` — NOT `~`).
