 *  - only `kind:'state'` events (which carry a `state`) move the working/waiting/blocked/done
 *    state, guarded by the same done-holdoff (a late, non-newTurn `working` must not resurrect a
 *    turn that just finished);
 *  - `kind:'session'` (start/end) resets the node to idle (state cleared), like the renderer's
 *    `setState(id, undefined)`;
 *  - `subagent-start` / `subagent-end` / `recurring` events do NOT touch the main state — they
 *    only capture identity (agentId / sessionId), exactly as the renderer routes them to the
 *    subagent / loop stores instead of `setState`.
 * `sessionId`/`agentId` are captured off any event (the renderer calls `setSessionId` on every

 * boot started with an empty `state` map + empty `inboxEvents`. Because the headless service is
 * `Type=simple` (KillMode=control-group), a `systemctl restart` SIGTERMs the whole cgroup — the
 * app's tmux server included — so its sessions die; each reconnect then cold-restores the node and
 * re-launches `claude --resume`, whose completed turn re-emits `Stop` → a `done` carrying the SAME
 * `last_assistant_message`. With `prevState === undefined` after boot, `produceInboxFromState`'s
 * done-EDGE guard (`nextState === 'done' && prevState !== 'done'`) always fired, re-producing the
 * done and re-firing `onInboxActionable` → the duplicate push (and, come the nightly auto-update
 * timer, a nightly duplicate for every lingering done).
 *
 * Restoring `state` so `prevState` survives makes the done-edge guard suppress an identical
 * re-`done` on its own; restoring `inboxEvents` makes the approval/question title-dedup
 * (`newestUnresolved`) survive too, closing the same class for needs-you re-pushes. A restored
 * state is NOT a new event — this NEVER calls a listener, so no push/live-update fires on boot.
 * Fail-open: a missing / unreadable / corrupt file leaves memory empty, i.e. bit-for-bit legacy
 * behavior. Stale entries are dropped with the SAME expiry sweep `buildFile`/`flush` apply, so a
 * "working" from a long-dead session is never resurrected.
