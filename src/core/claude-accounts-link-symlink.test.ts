/**
 * Linking a config dir whose `settings.json` is a SYMLINK must keep it a symlink.
 *
 * This is not a hypothetical shape — it is the layout the feature was built for. A user running
 * two logins keeps `~/.claude-2` with `settings.json`, `hooks/`, `skills/` and `projects/` all
 * symlinked into `~/.claude/`, so the two identities share one configuration and differ only in
 * `.claude.json` + `.credentials.json`. If `link` replaced the link with a regular file, the two
 * profiles would silently fork: every later edit to the real `~/.claude/settings.json` — including
 * this app's own hook upgrades — would stop reaching the second account.
 *
 * Deliberately NO `vi.mock` here (unlike claude-accounts-service.test.ts, which observes the
 * installer): the property under test is what the REAL writer does to a REAL symlink, and a mock
 * of the writer is exactly the fixture that cannot discriminate.
 *
 * MUTATION: swap `installHooksInto`'s `writeFileSync` for an unlink-then-write, or for the atomic
 * write-temp-then-rename this repo uses for PUBLISHED files, and the symlink assertion reddens.
 * (Atomic rename is the right rule for a file we own and the wrong one here: `renameAtomic`
 * REPLACES the link with the temp file, which is the fork this test exists to prevent. That is
 * why `installHooksInto` is left writing in place — the file belongs to the CLI, not to us.)
