/**
 * Shared-identity spine for Codex canvas nodes.
 *
 * WHY: a Codex terminal node used to spawn a full `codex` process tree per node — one app-server
 * each. A canvas with a dozen Codex nodes paid a dozen servers' worth of RAM for one account. With
 * this, every node on a machine talks to ONE `codex app-server` and owns one THREAD inside it, and
 * the node ↔ thread mapping is what survives resumes, in-pane restarts and app restarts.
 *
 * The mapping is a tiny file per thread under `<userDataDir>/codex-thread-nodes/`. It is read by
 * generated POSIX sh (the hook prelude in `codex-thread-identity-sh.ts`), so it is a flat
 * `key=value` text file — parsed as DATA, never sourced.
 *
 * WHY IT IS SIGNED: the records name a node id and a hook endpoint, and the hook prelude
 * re-exports both into the agent's environment. An attacker who could write one of these files
 * could aim a session's hook traffic at a node (or an endpoint) of their choosing. Every record
 * therefore carries an HMAC over (threadId, nodeId, endpoint) keyed by the same restart-stable
 * secret the hook server uses to mint per-node capabilities
 * (`src/core/agents/node-auth-secret.ts` — sealed via safeStorage on the desktop, raw 0600 bytes on
 * the Server Edition). Unsigned/mis-signed records are ignored, not repaired.
 *
 * ACCOUNT SCOPING (S6): managed Codex accounts add a directory level above the thread id. A
 * SYSTEM record still lives at the bare root (`<root>/<threadId>`), so a machine with no managed
 * accounts keeps the exact S4 layout and its legacy records keep resolving (Constraint 12). A
 * MANAGED record lives under `<root>/<accountId>/<threadId>`. The HMAC now binds the full 4-tuple
 * (threadId, accountScope, nodeId, hookEndpoint) — an empty account id is normalised to the scope
 * string `system`, and a record whose `accountId=` line disagrees with the directory it sits in is
 * rejected, so an account can never be edited to speak for another's threads. Records written
 * before this slice carry no `accountId=` line and are verified with the original 3-tuple preimage
 * at the system scope only — the one back-compat door, and it is a system-scope door.
 *
 * AGENT IDENTITY: a record also carries `agentId=` and `canvasControl=`, because the prelude
 * re-exports both into a tool shell and used to HARDCODE them (`codex`, granted). Hardcoding
 * mislabels every custom agent that inherits the codex harness (`custom:<uuid>`, not `codex`) and
 * asserts a grant the pane may not hold — `buildPtyEnv` gates it on `canControlCanvas`, and
 * `SHARED_IDENTITY_CAPABLE ⊆ CANVAS_CONTROL_CAPABLE` is the only reason the two agree today, a
 * coincidence the list's own comment invites the next agent to break. The HMAC therefore binds the
 * 6-tuple (threadId, accountScope, nodeId, hookEndpoint, agentId, canvasControl). A record with no
 * `agentId=` line is pre-agent and is read with the implied values `codex` + granted, which is
 * exactly what it meant when it was written; the preimages are SELECTED by shape, never tried in
 * turn, so a record that names an agent can never be verified by one that ignores it.

 * used to HARDCODE `NODETERM_AGENT_ID=codex` and `NODETERM_CANVAS_CONTROL=1`. Both are facts about
 * the PANE that only `hookServer.buildPtyEnv` knows — it sets `NODETERM_AGENT_ID` to the node's own
 * agent id (which is `custom:<uuid>` for a custom agent declaring `baseAgent: 'codex'`, not
 * `codex`) and gates the grant on `canControlCanvas`. A constant in the prelude is the prelude
 * asserting what it cannot know: it mislabels every custom codex-based agent, and it hands out a
 * grant the pane may not hold. Recording them is what lets the prelude EXPORT WHAT THE RECORD SAYS.
 *
 * The grant is not merely derived from the agent id here because the prelude is POSIX sh and cannot
 * evaluate `canControlCanvas` — the membership list plus the custom-agent base resolver live in
 * TypeScript. So the decision is made once, on the desktop, by the same predicate `buildPtyEnv`
 * uses, and travels as a boolean.
 *
 * BOTH FIELDS ARE INSIDE THE SIGNATURE. They name a capability the prelude then exports into an

 *     3-tuple fallback for a legacy record that has no line at all.
 *
 * Check (1) (line-vs-directory) is defence in depth, kept legible rather than removed. What carries
 * Property 7 is the SCOPE-bound HMAC in check (2): a record signed for `acct-A` verifies only with
 * the preimage scope `acct-A`, so re-filing it under `acct-B` fails the MAC regardless of the line
 * check. The legacy 3-tuple fallback is the ONE back-compat door and is restricted to the SYSTEM
 * scope, so a scope-less signature can never be honoured under a managed account. (The mutations
 * that redden these tests are the HMAC one and the `scope === SYSTEM_ACCOUNT_SCOPE` fallback guard;
 * check (1) is redundant with the scope-bound HMAC and is documented as such.)
 *
 * THREE PREIMAGE GENERATIONS, SELECTED — NOT TRIED IN TURN. Which one applies is decided by which
 * LINES the record carries, and exactly one branch runs:
 *   - an `agentId=` line ⇒ the current 6-tuple, and ONLY that;
 *   - no agent line but an `accountId=` line ⇒ the 4-tuple (an S6-era record);
 *   - neither, at the system scope ⇒ the 3-tuple (a pre-S6 record).
 * Selecting rather than falling through is the load-bearing part. A record that DOES name an agent
 * must never verify under a preimage that ignores the agent: that is the door through which an
 * `agentId=custom:…` line could be stripped or rewritten and the record still accepted, putting the
 * prelude back to guessing `codex` — the precise defect this generation exists to close. A caller
 * that wants the old behaviour must present an old-SHAPED record, and an old-shaped record gets the
 * documented implied values (see `parseCodexThreadIdentity`), never a mix of the two.

 * agent TUI — text injected into an agent's terminal is prompt injection, which this repo forbids.
 * The supervisor may print a transport status only after the TUI has exited.
