// The context meter's mount-time rehydration (`context:ensure`), registered through the
// CorePlatform seam so BOTH shells serve it.
//
// This lived inline in `src/main/index.ts`, and the Server Edition had no handler at all — the
// browser cast into the void, so a Server-Edition claude node's meter also filled only on its next
// turn. Exactly the gap `core/transcript-ipc.ts` was moved here to close for the READ channels.
//
// What it is for: a tmux session outlives the app, so after a restart a continuing agent session is
// idle and emits no hook event — and a hook event is the only other thing that ever feeds the
// meter. Without a mount-time read the meter stays blank until the user sends a prompt.
//
// TWO rules shape everything below.
//
// 1. **Per agent, never one resolver for all of them.** Claude's `resolveTranscript` has a cwd
//    fallback that answers *the newest claude transcript for that cwd*, and a codex/gemini session
//    id always misses its sessionId leg — so pointing it at a non-claude node hands that node a
//    STRANGER's session as its meter (wrong numerator and wrong denominator), then flaps against
//    the correct tail. That is why `readsClaudeTranscript` gates the renderer today and why this
//    routes instead of widening it: each agent resolves through its OWN locator and tracks on its
//    OWN tail (whose own `parse` keeps the per-agent token formulas separate, as they must be).
// 2. **A remote session is resolved on the HOST or not at all.** For an SSH-project node the
//    transcript is on the other machine; falling through to any local resolver searches this
//    machine's disk for a file that only ever existed there. So the remote leg's "could not
//    resolve" is TERMINAL, never a fall-through — and it is never remembered as an absence either
//    (see `ContextEnsureDeps.ensureRemote`).
