/**
 * ── WHY THE DELIVERY BELOW EXISTS, AND WHAT IT REPLACED ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A multi-line write must reach a paste-aware TUI INSIDE a bracketed-paste frame. Framed, the app
 * reads the whole thing as one pasted block; unframed, every `\n` is a submit, so a three-line
 * note push becomes three turns (herdr :260) and the last one races the Enter that follows it.
 *
 * The previous design asked tmux WHETHER to frame — `display-message -p '#{bracket_paste_flag}'`
 * — and framed the body itself. Measured: that format FIRST SHIPPED IN TMUX 3.7 (2026-06-26,
 * CHANGES "FROM 3.6b TO 3.7"). On every earlier tmux it is an unknown name that expands to the
 * empty string, so the probe answered false for EVERY pane. And a false answer did not refuse —
 * it fell through to the legacy two-step, which delivered `line1\nline2\nline3` + `\r` raw into
 * the app. Measured on this host (tmux 3.4): exactly those bytes. Ubuntu 24.04 ships 3.4, 22.04
 * → 3.2a, Debian 12/13 → 3.3a/3.5a, Ubuntu 26.04 → 3.6a — plus every SSH target, where the
 * REMOTE host's tmux decides. So the mangle was the norm, not the exception.
 *
 * `paste-buffer -p` removes the question. tmux inserts the bracket codes "if the application has
 * requested bracketed paste mode" — it consults the pane's REAL DECSET 2004 state itself, the
 * state it has tracked since long before it could format it. Introduced 2012-03-03, shipped in
 * TMUX 1.7. There is no version floor left to hit.
 *
 * Measured on tmux 3.4, against a raw-mode reader that records the bytes its stdin actually got:
 *  - app requested 2004 → `ESC[200~ … ESC[201~` then the Enter's `\r`
 *  - app did not        → the text, unframed, byte-identical to the legacy two-step
 *  - a NON-ACTIVE pane  → still framed correctly
 *  - `-r`               → `\n` survives as `\n` (WITHOUT it tmux rewrites every `\n` to `\r`,
 *                          which is the per-line submit this whole thing exists to avoid)
 *  - `-d` + a private buffer name → the user's own numbered buffer stack is untouched
 */

 *
 * Unique per call, not a constant: tmux interleaves command lists from DIFFERENT clients, so two
 * concurrent `sendText`s sharing one buffer name would have the second `load-buffer` overwrite
 * the first's payload before its `paste-buffer` ran — one pane gets the other's text, and the
 * loser's write vanishes. The name is `[a-z0-9-]` only, because it is spliced into a tmux command
 * string and (on the SSH leg) a remote shell line.

 * The ONE tmux invocation that delivers `sendText`'s payload: load the buffer from STDIN, leave
 * copy mode if the pane is in it, let tmux paste-and-frame it, then Enter. The text itself is not
 * here — it goes over stdin, which is both the ARG_MAX fix and this repo's standing rule.
 *
 * ARG_MAX, measured on this host: `set-buffer -- "$text"` with a 300 KB payload dies with
 * "Argument list too long" (a single argument is capped at MAX_ARG_STRLEN = 128 KB, well under
 * the 2 MB `getconf ARG_MAX`). The same 300 KB through `load-buffer -` lands intact and framed.
 *
 * ── COPY MODE, AND WHY THE CANCEL IS GATED INSIDE TMUX ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * With `#{pane_in_mode}` = 1 (a wheel scroll is enough — nodeterm's tmux has the mouse on),
 * `paste-buffer -p` delivers UNFRAMED: tmux checks the copy-mode screen rather than the app. So
 * the per-line-submit bug comes straight back for a user who happened to be scrolled up. Worse,
 * measured: the trailing `send-keys Enter` is eaten by the copy-mode key table and never reaches
 * the app at all. `send-keys -X cancel` first restores both.
 *
 * The cancel is NOT unconditional. Measured on 3.4: `send-keys -X cancel` against a pane that is
 * NOT in a mode FAILS ("not in a mode", exit 1) and ABORTS THE REST OF THE COMMAND LIST — nothing
 * is pasted, no Enter, and the delivery reports failure. An unconditional cancel would therefore
 * break every ordinary write, which is the opposite of the bug being fixed.
 *
 * `if-shell -F` evaluates a FORMAT (no shell, no fork) and runs its command only when the format
 * is non-zero, so the gate rides inside the same single invocation: no extra round trip, and no
 * probe of ours that a future tmux could change the answer to.
 *
 * The user-visible cost is real but bounded to the case that already misbehaved: a human reading
 * scrollback is scrolled back to the live view. It is not a regression, because TODAY that same
 * pane gets NOTHING — measured: `send-keys -l --` + `send-keys Enter` into a copy-mode pane exits
 * 0 and delivers zero bytes, so `sendText` returns true having written nothing at all.
 *
 * The target is spliced UNQUOTED into the `if-shell` command string (tmux's own lexer parses it),
 * so it must be a name this app generated; `isSessionName` is asserted rather than assumed.

 * The framed-plan trio delivered the agent-messaging envelope as a payload that CARRIED its own
 * `ESC[200~ … ESC[201~ \r` frame, pasted with `paste-buffer -r` and no `-p` ("tmux must not
 * re-frame bytes that already carry their frame") and no separate Enter ("text and submit are one
 * write"). Both premises died with tmux 3.7 (issue #453, measured on 3.7b — the version the macOS
 * app bundles): `paste-buffer` now passes the buffer content through vis(3)
 * (`utf8_stravisx(VIS_SAFE|VIS_NOSLASH)`, CHANGES: "Pass paste buffer through vis(3) when
 * pasting…"), which rewrites every ESC byte into the printable pair `^[` — so the hand-rolled
 * frame arrived as LITERAL TEXT (`^[[200~…^[[201~`) in the target's composer, and the `\r` riding
 * inside the now-frameless burst was absorbed as pasted content instead of a submit. On tmux ≤ 3.6
 * the same bytes passed through verbatim and worked, which is why every Linux CI run stayed green
 * while the bundled-tmux macOS build was broken.
 *
 * The envelope now rides the SAME plan as every other write (`localPasteDelivery` above, enter
 * always true — see `PtyManager.sendEnvelope`): tmux inserts the frame from the pane's real
 * bracketed-paste state (`-p`; vis(3) is applied to buffer CONTENT only, never to tmux's own
 * markers — measured on 3.7b: the markers arrive as real ESC bytes, the content untouched), and
 * the Enter is its own key event AFTER the close marker, which a paste-aware composer cannot
 * re-chunk into the paste (the herdr :48 race only existed for UNMARKED bursts). Do not resurrect
 * a plan that puts an ESC byte into a paste buffer: on tmux ≥ 3.7 it cannot arrive as an escape.
