# Get linked context

On the nodeterm canvas, this Claude session may be connected to other agent nodes (Claude, Codex or Gemini) by a
context-link edge. When you are linked, you can READ the other node's context on demand by
running the local CLI shim below. Nothing is pushed to you automatically — pull what you need.

Run the shim (absolute path):

\`\`\`sh
sh "${shimPath}" <command> [--node <id|title>] [-n <N>]
\`\`\`

Commands:
- \`list\` — list the nodes you are linked to (start here).
- \`summary [--node X] [-n 15]\` — the last N lines of a linked node's conversation.
- \`transcript [--node X]\` — the linked node's full conversation transcript.
- \`terminal [--node X]\` — the linked node's recent terminal output (visible buffer).

Linked sticky notes appear in \`list\` marked \`(note)\`; \`summary\` or \`transcript\` on a note
prints its **current** text (the note is read live from the canvas, so it may have changed
since it was first linked).

\`--node\` is optional when you are linked to exactly one node; otherwise pass the id or title
from \`list\`. If the CLI says "Not a nodeterm session" or "No linked nodes", there is nothing
to read — do not retry.
