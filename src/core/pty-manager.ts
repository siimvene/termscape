// Minimal tmux config so the user's ~/.tmux.conf never interferes. The tmux server

//
// The mouse is ON, i.e. TMUX owns scrolling and selection — this is the native behavior, and the
// capabilities are deliberately NOT blanked, so the client uses the ALTERNATE screen (\e[?1049h).
// A previous design took scrolling away from tmux (mouse off + `smcup@:rmcup@:indn@`, normal
// screen, output flowing into the emulator's own scrollback, hydrated from `capture-pane` on
// reattach) and it failed structurally: tmux is a screen PAINTER, not a stream — every redraw
// (attach, resize, refresh) erases and repaints, so blank and duplicated rows leaked into the
// emulator's scrollback (black bands, duplicated screens) and a full-screen TUI's input box
// scrolled away with the text instead of staying put. Do not re-derive that: with the mouse on,
// the wheel scrolls tmux's OWN history, the pane stays sticky, and there is nothing to hydrate.
//
// COPY: selection is tmux copy-mode, and the clipboard is reached via OSC 52 — `set-clipboard on`
// plus `terminal-features ",*:clipboard"`. The `terminal-features` entry is the load-bearing one:
// on tmux 3.2+ the old `terminal-overrides ',xterm*:Ms=\E]52;...'` route does NOT work (measured:
// a copy emitted ZERO OSC 52 to the attached client with the `Ms=` override, and the correct
// payload with `terminal-features`). The renderer's OSC 52 handler writes the system clipboard, so
// this is the copy path on EVERY platform and over SSH — no `pbcopy` pipe (that was macOS-only,
// and half of why copying was broken).
/**
 * Session-identity env names the LOCAL conf's `update-environment` carries on top of the stock +

 * shared tmux server inherits the env of whichever client STARTS it, so a server started by a
 * managed-account node's client held that account's `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` in its GLOBAL env — and
 * every later session created withOUT a `-e` override (system-account nodes, plain terminals, and
 * the missing-dir fallback) inherited it and silently ran as that account ("the system account is
 * entangled with the next account in the list"). With the names listed, tmux copies each one from
 * the creating CLIENT's env — set for the node that owns it, and STRIPPED from the session when
 * the client lacks it (measured in session-env.realtmux.test.ts, seeded-server case included).
 * The auth-strip names ride along for the same reason: deleting them from the client env alone
 * never touched a seeded server's global copy, so a managed-OAuth node could still run on an
 * inherited API key. LOCAL conf only — see `tmuxUpdateEnvironmentLine` for why the remote conf

   *    points that can start a control client of ours.
   *  - a PAINTER pty client is still attached for this node. A session never has both: the painter
   *    attaches with `-D` (it would kick the shadow off a moment later anyway), and two clients of

   *  - the node is REMOTE (an SSH project): its tmux runs on the far host, not on our socket.

   * this process that decides "is somebody watching" can see it — the reap sweep asks
   * `platform().clientIds()` and walks `this.sessions`, and the renderer's park and offscreen
   * dispose are per-node renderer state.

   *
   * WHAT PAINTS THE JOINER'S SCREEN. Its xterm is brand-new and empty, and `fresh:false` has just
   * told it to skip the scrollback replay. The only other thing that could paint it is a tmux
   * redraw — and tmux redraws on SIGWINCH, i.e. only when `applySize` below actually RESIZES the

   * EXPECTED case (the node's persisted geometry and the font settings are the same on both
   * clients, and canvas zoom is a CSS transform that doesn't change `clientWidth`), and equal or
   * larger resizes nothing — so the headline path of the whole feature, "open the same terminal in
   * a second client", would land on a blank-but-live terminal until the next byte of output.
   *
   * So a join that did NOT resize carries the current screen (`PtyCreateResult.screen`), captured
   * from tmux with the same `captureForResync` the drop-and-redraw path already uses. It rides the
   * create RESULT rather than a `pty:resync` event on purpose: the renderer only subscribes to this
   * session's channels AFTER create() resolves, so an event pushed here would land on no listener.
   * A join that DID resize gets nothing — tmux paints it, and two paints would splice two different
   * points in time onto one screen.
   *
   * The capture is skipped entirely (not just discarded) when the pty resized, so the solo paths
   * pay nothing: a solo user never reaches `join` at all (a fresh spawn has nothing to paint, and a
   * warm reattach spawns a tmux client, which redraws by itself).

    // failed spawn (there is a third, smaller leak of one device per SUCCESSFUL spawn from the
    // `low_fds` cleanup loop's off-by-one). That makes exhaustion self-amplifying: at the ceiling
    // every spawn fails, every failure eats two more devices, and each retry pushes the ceiling
    // further away — a 31-minute-old main held 479 masters against 28 tmux panes and dozens of
    // consecutive failed creates. The leak is node-pty's to fix; ours is to stop feeding it.
    //
    // FIRST STATEMENT IN THE FUNCTION, ahead of the swap-out below, because a refusal must leave
    // the node exactly as it found it. Retiring the shadow first would trade a live background
    // client for nothing at all: the painter it was making way for never arrives, and nothing
    // re-attaches a shadow (`shadowAttach` is driven by release/reap, not by a failed create), so
    // a node nobody is watching would go quietly dark on a machine that is merely full. Nothing
    // between here and `pty.spawn` is needed to decide this — the reading is machine-wide.
    //
    // FAIL-OPEN is the rule here: `ptyDevicesExhausted` is false for anything unmeasured
    // (non-darwin, a `sysctl` that failed, or a ceiling whose async prime — kicked in `init` — has
    // not landed yet), so an unknown machine spawns exactly as it always did. Refusing a terminal
    // on a machine that had room would be a worse bug than the leak this avoids.
    //
    // AND THAT IS THE WHOLE FIX — no backoff, no circuit breaker, deliberately. The bursts of
    // consecutive failed creates in the field log are not a retry storm: NOTHING re-attempts a
    // create that failed. The renderer's create rejection lands in one `.catch` that only records
    // `spawnError` for the node's overlay (TerminalNode.tsx) — no timer, no respawn bump, and no
    // `reportSshDrop`, so a failure cannot even feed the SSH reconnect coordinator (whose own loop
    // is bounded anyway: 1→2→4→8→15s, then parked until a `connected` event, plus a 10s re-drop
    // refusal). A burst is therefore N DISTINCT nodes each trying exactly once, fanned out by one
    // moment — app boot, a project tab switch past the park window, an agent's bulk
    // `open-terminal --count N`, or one reconnect flush. Rate-limiting that would only stagger

   *
   * Everything decided per write — `sanitizePasteText`, the empty-body case, the per-call buffer
   * name, and the buffer sweep when the paste fails — lives in `localPasteDelivery` /
   * `remotePasteDelivery` / `runPasteDelivery`, which a real-tmux test drives DIRECTLY.
   *
   * That is a correction, not a preference. The first version of this change inlined those
   * decisions here and let the test rebuild them in its own helper. Both sides were green and two
   * mutations survived a full run: deleting the empty-body branch, and deleting the sanitize call.
   * A test that re-implements what it is testing cannot notice the original being removed. So the
   * composition is exported, both callers use it, and the only thing left in this method is which
   * transport runs it.
