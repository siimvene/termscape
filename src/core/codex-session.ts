// Reader over a codex rollout (`~/.codex/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-*.jsonl` — the same root
// `handoff/locate.ts`'s `locateCodex` walks). Codex's hook envelope is claude-shaped and carries
// `session_id` / `transcript_path` / `cwd` / `hook_event_name` (its own hook wire structs name
// exactly those fields), so the shells hand us the path.
//
// Codex is the only agent that states its OWN context window in its transcript
// (`model_context_window`), which is strictly better than inferring one: claude's window has to be
// guessed from the model family (core/model-window.ts) and gemini's from its model id.

/**
 * The latest live context size plus the window codex reported.
 *
 * **`last_token_usage`, not `total_token_usage`.** Both sit side by side in the same `token_count`
 * event, and `total_token_usage` is CUMULATIVE over the session — measured across the
 * token_count events of `__fixtures__/codex/rollout.jsonl` it runs 17855 → 204277 while
 * `last_token_usage` runs 17855 → 34635, against a 258400 window. Using the cumulative field would
 * have shown that session at 79% when it was really at 13%, and would have sailed past 100% a
 * couple of turns later. `last_token_usage` is the most recent REQUEST, and since every request
 * re-sends the whole conversation, its input is the live context size.
 *
 * `usedTokens` = `last_token_usage.input_tokens` alone:
 *  - `cached_input_tokens` is NOT added. Verified over every usage record in `~/.codex/sessions`:
 *    `input_tokens + output_tokens === total_tokens` and `cached_input_tokens <= input_tokens`, so
 *    cached input is already counted inside `input_tokens`. It does occupy the window; adding it
 *    again would double-count it.
 *  - output/reasoning tokens are excluded, matching what `context-tail.ts:parseLatestUsage` counts
 *    for claude (its three INPUT-side fields), so the same meter means the same thing on both.
 *
 * Measured shape (codex-cli 0.146.0):
 *   {"type":"event_msg","payload":{"type":"token_count","info":{
 *      "total_token_usage":{…},
 *      "last_token_usage":{"input_tokens":34635,"cached_input_tokens":33792,…},
 *      "model_context_window":258400}}}
 * Note the nesting: everything is under `payload.info`, NOT at the top level.
