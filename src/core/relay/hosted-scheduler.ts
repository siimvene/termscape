// The standing listener lifecycle for a hosted team: keep ONE idle relay listener registered under
// the host's room, refresh it before its token expires, replace it the moment it bridges a peer,
// and back off on failure. A port of the desktop's rules in src/main/remote/standing-host.ts, made
// pure over injected deps so the measured incidents those rules encode are unit-tested here:
//  - the backoff resets only on PROOF THE RELAY LEG WORKS (an IDLE listener holds its registration
//    to its refresh, or a peer bridges) — never on a successful mint. When the API is up and the
//    relay is down every mint succeeds and every socket dies at once, and a reset on mint re-minted
//    at round-trip speed until the API's per-IP limit answered 429 (relay log, 2026-09-27);
//  - a BRIDGED listener's refresh is not proof: that socket registered long ago, so it says nothing
//    about whether a NEW registration works. The desktop counts it, and with one long-lived session
//    beside a relay refusing new registrations that restarted the idle backoff at 1 s every 90 s;
//  - at most MINT_BUDGET_PER_HOUR successful mints in any rolling hour, whatever asks for them. The
//    backend's free limit is 240/h, the 15 s backoff ceiling alone reaches exactly 240/h, and a peer
//    joining and leaving every 10 s asks for 360/h — so no per-path rule can hold the line on its own;
//  - a 429 waits at least 60 s (longer if Retry-After says so); a 402/403 stops minting (a refused
//    key proof names itself in `lastError`; a 403 host-token.ts judges transient arrives as
//    `network` and backs off);
//  - a key-proof refusal stops minting only on the SECOND in a row: a POP_SECRET rotation, or a
//    secret mismatch between backend instances, inside ONE challenge→mint pair refuses an honest
//    host once. The first is backed off like a transient 403 (the retry fetches a fresh challenge);
//    only a successful mint or start() resets the count — a transient failure in between does not,
//    or a backend refusing every proof behind a flaky challenge would retry forever. Both refusals
//    are logged with their kind (warn, then error), so an operator can tell the two apart;
//  - while a backoff timer is armed it owns the next mint: nothing else may mint early;
//  - a live link caps its bridged sessions (`maxBridged`): while full, no idle listener is kept (the
//    broker turns further clients away), nothing is minted and no timer is armed; a session ending
//    reopens ONE through the usual top().
// Everything the injected deps can throw is caught: a scheduler that swallowed an exception would sit
// in 'running' with no listener and no timer, i.e. hosting silently dead until a restart.
