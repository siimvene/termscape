// Hosted team relay: the Server Edition side of docs/hosted-team-relay.md.
// Composes the host key, team store, standing-listener scheduler and access policy around the core
// relay host. All relay-peer traffic crosses relay-host.ts's hooks; hosted RPCs (relay:hosted:*)
// are INTERCEPTED there and never registered on the platform, so a Server Edition browser client
// (whose gate is the server password, not a team role) cannot call them.
//
// The rules the file rests on:
//  - The ROLE is read from the team store on every decision (access, sink filter, narrowing,
//    interceptors) and never cached on a session, so a removal or a promotion applies to the very
//    next message. A session whose key has NO team entry is served nothing at all — that is the
//    window between a removal's team write and its kill — except one whose own approval could not
//    be written (`pinFailed`), which keeps the lowest role. Removal also cuts the live session.
//  - Every hook derives the peer key from the SESSION it is handed, never from this file's own
//    record of it (which is only filled in once `connectRelayHost` returns).
//  - An interceptor bypasses `access` and the scope jails, so each one checks the CALLER's own
//    session key against the team store: `relay:hosted:self` is open to any member, approve / deny /
//    invite-code / pending to owners only.
//  - Pending requests are told to connected OWNERS only (never a broadcast: a viewer must not learn
//    who is knocking), and an owner who connects later is told the ones still open. At most one
//    request per device key, and at most PENDING_MAX at once.
//  - An approval is pinned only once both humans confirmed. A deny or an expiry that lands while
//    that pin is still being written wins: the write is skipped, or taken back. A peer that merely
//    drops meanwhile keeps its pin — both humans did approve. A key that already has an entry when
//    the pin is written (a racing `team add-owner`) keeps it: the approval writes nothing.
//  - A relay peer never saves the host's workspace (`workspace:save` is refused for every role): the
//    host's canvas authority writes shared projects' content from canvas ops alone, and the share
//    set it governs is read through `sharedProjectIds()` and announced by `onSharedChange`. Every
//    connected MEMBER (viewers too) is told the whole new set on `relay:hosted:shared-changed`.
//  - The scheduler hears about EVERY session end. The core fires `onClose` only for ends the shell
//    did not ask for; every end this service causes (deny, expiry, removal, a listener the
//    scheduler closes) runs the same `ended` bookkeeping, at most once per session.
