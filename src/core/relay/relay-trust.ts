// The connection-level trust gate: the ONE place a peer's confirmation is accepted.
//
// Stage 4 makes two desktops equal peers, which means a pairing GRANTS THE PEER SHELL ACCESS on this
// machine. The only thing standing between a relay man-in-the-middle and that shell is mutual
// approval: BOTH humans compare the same 6-digit SAS out of band and BOTH press Confirm. The pure
// latch is `mutual-approval-core.ts`; this file is the wiring it says it cannot enforce, and the
// wiring is where the property can be silently destroyed.
//
// SECURITY — obligation (a) of mutual-approval-core.ts: `onTunnelText` is called ONLY from
// `connectRelay`'s `onTunnel` callback (relay-socket.ts), which fires only for a payload that
//   (1) DECRYPTED under THIS session's key (deriveSessionKey — fresh nonces both ways),
//   (2) carried the PEER's role byte (so a relay cannot reflect our own confirm back at us), and
//   (3) beat the per-direction monotonic replay counter.
// A plaintext frame from the relay reaches `handleControl` (which understands only `e2ee_hello` /
// `e2ee_ready`) and dies there; it can never reach this module. That is what makes `confirmRemote`
// proof that the REAL peer's human confirmed — and it is exactly what relay-trust.test.ts forges
// against. NEVER add a second call site for `confirmRemote`: not `onRpc`, not `onFrame`, not an IPC
// message from the renderer, not a plaintext handshake control. If a confirm can arrive any other
// way, mutual approval degrades back to ONE-WAY and the local human alone unlocks shell access while
// believing the remote human agreed. The SAS-mismatch backstop does NOT catch that (it catches key
// substitution, not a same-key relay forging the confirm DIRECTION).
//
// SECURITY — obligation (b): EXACTLY ONE `MutualApproval` per pairing attempt, seeded from THIS
// session's ECDH peer key (the key whose shared secret produced the SAS the humans compared). The
// state lives in this closure, is created once per gate, and each connection hangs its own gate off
// its own `onTunnel` — so a confirm arriving on session A's tunnel is physically unable to reach
// session B's state, and `recordApproval` can only ever pin the key bound into the state it is given.
//
// LOCAL confirms have exactly six call sites, four on the HOST side and two on the CLIENT side.
// Host side: `confirmHere()` from the desktop's Team Access dialog (`relay:host:confirm`), the host's
// `autoApprove` for a key its pin store holds (the hosted team's `team.json`), a hosted owner's
// `relay:hosted:approve`, and a live link's `autoApprove` for the ONE viewer key derived from that
// link's own secret, read from the host's own link record (src/core/watch-link/link-host.ts; any
// other key is denied at once, never asked). Client side: the joining human's
// `relay:client:confirm`, and the client's `autoApprove` for a hosted team's approved bookmark
// (src/main/remote/hosted-join.ts). That auto-confirm reads the bookmark's `approvedAt` alone
// (`source` is a label). Share with team's `seedBookmark` sets it without a SAS comparison; that is
// not a new confirm site, because the code it is given came back from `team bootstrap` over an
// authenticated ssh channel. A seventh is a design change.
