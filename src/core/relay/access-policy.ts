// Hosted-relay roles are a SECURITY BOUNDARY, enforced here, at the one choke point every relay
// peer message crosses (relay-host.ts hooks). The UI only mirrors it.
//
// Two rules the whole file rests on:
//  - DENY BY DEFAULT for non-editors, in BOTH directions. Inbound, a method is reachable by a
//    Viewer/Commenter only if it is in VIEW/COMMENT below. Outbound, an event reaches them only if
//    it is in VIEW_EVENTS / VIEW_EVENT_PREFIXES: the core BROADCASTS to every attached client (the
//    debug log stream, whole project documents, account usage…), so an allow-by-default filter
//    would hand a viewer everything nobody remembered to list. A channel added tomorrow is
//    Editor-only, in and out, until someone decides otherwise.
//  - "READ" IS NOT "SAFE": relay peers were fully trusted, so fs:read is not jailed, pty:create on
//    any persistKey joins OR SPAWNS (and its options can name an ssh route), and two git "reads"
//    are not reads at all — `git diff --no-index` diffs any file on the host, and a `git show` ref
//    that starts with `-` is parsed as an option (`--output=<file>` WRITES a file). Git also reads
//    past the folder: `git show <ref>:<path>` resolves `<path>` against the REPOSITORY's top level,
//    so git needs the shared root to be its own repository. And a shared root can contain this
//    server's data directory, which no non-editor reads. Every VIEW entry therefore carries its own
//    argument check.
//
// Editors and owners pass untouched: Editor is shell access by definition, so gating them would be
// theatre.
