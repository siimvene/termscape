// A Team Access relay session bound to ONE project (`sharedProjectId`) is a SECURITY BOUNDARY, enforced
// here, at the one choke point every relay-peer message crosses (relay-host.ts hooks).
//
// What the invite consents to, and what it does not (the policy these rules implement):
//  - It IS consent to run commands in the shared project: a scoped guest opens terminals and agents
//    there (`pty:create` with its own shell/command), edits its files, runs git in it, moves its
//    board cards and comments. None of that is gated beyond "is it in the shared project".
//  - It is NOT consent to other projects on this machine (their canvases, their live tmux sessions,
//    their transcripts, their files, their board and GitHub data), nor to the host's secrets and
//    control plane (settings, license, accounts, gateway credentials, pairing). Those are refused.
//
// How: DENY BY DEFAULT in both directions, like the hosted-team viewer policy (access-policy.ts),
// but for a guest that is an EDITOR inside its project. Inbound, a method is reachable only if it is
// in `SCOPED` below, and each entry carries its own argument check (a node id must belong to the
// shared project, a path must realpath inside the project root, a projectId must be the shared one).
// A channel added tomorrow is refused to scoped guests until someone decides otherwise; the guard
// test (scoped-guest-policy.guard.test.ts) forces that decision for every channel the relay tab can
// send. Outbound, the peer receives only the events the viewer policy already attributes to a
// shared project (VIEW_EVENTS) plus the two an editor's tab also listens on.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT CLAIM. A scoped guest has a shell in the project, as the host's user. From that
// shell it can `cd` anywhere the user can, read any file the user can read, and even attach to
// another project's tmux session on the shared socket. The fs/git jails and the node checks below
// close the APP's doors (every RPC the relay tab speaks), which is what turns "scoped" from a UI
// label into something an attacker cannot bypass by sending a crafted RPC — but they are not an OS
// sandbox. What the shell cannot reach without a prompt are keychain-held secrets, and the host's
// secret-bearing RPCs (settings:save + agent:discover-models, accounts, license) are host-only for
// every peer (shared/host-control.ts). The invite copy says exactly this.
