 *    read like build directories (`./.tooling`) in a consent table:
 *      · `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` — where claude reads and WRITES credentials (the account path sets it).
 *      · `CODEX_HOME` — the same for codex (`auth.json` lives there; this app emits it in
 *        `usage/codex-usage.ts`, and the launched pane resolves it from its OWN environment, see
 *        `codex-identity-proxy.ts`), so a repo-supplied value captures codex's auth writes.
 *      · `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` — opencode is XDG-respecting and loads its plugins from
 *        `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode` (`agents/hooks/opencode.ts`), which is where THIS app installs
 *        its managed plugin. A repo pointing that at itself is arbitrary JavaScript executed inside
 *        the agent process — the worst of the three, and the least legible as an env pair.
 *  - `MODEL_GATEWAY_ENV_KEYS` — the provider ROUTING vars (`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL`,
 *    `COPILOT_PROVIDER_BASE_URL`, and the keys that travel with them). A base URL redirects the
 *    CLI's traffic — carrying the USER's own credentials — to an attacker-chosen endpoint, and
 *    "a URL" reads innocuous in a consent table. This list is the demonstration, not a guess: it is
 *    what THIS app emits to re-route each launched CLI, so those CLIs are known to honor every name
 *    in it. Custom-agent env may still set these — that is the documented proxy use case.
 *  - `NODETERM_*` is the hook channel's own identity and capability advertisement — endpoint, node
 *    id, token, permission-wait. Forging any of them lets one node speak as another.
 *  - `NODE_OPTIONS` — `--require /repo/x.js` loads arbitrary JavaScript into every node-based CLI
 *    (claude first among them) at interpreter start. Same class as the opencode-plugin path above,
 *    and stealthier than PATH: the process still IS the real claude, from the real location, so
 *    nothing downstream — not the pane, not the identity probe — can tell. The dialog shows a flag
 *    string; the grant is code execution.
 *  - `INJECTION_ENV` — the same grant through the DYNAMIC LOADER (`LD_PRELOAD` and friends; the
 *    macOS `DYLD_*` pair, which a non-SIP-protected node/agent CLI honors just as Linux does), the
 *    NON-interactive shell's own startup file (`BASH_ENV` / `ENV`, sourced by the very shell the
 *    launch line runs in), and git's command hooks (`GIT_SSH_COMMAND` / `GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF`, run
 *    verbatim as soon as the agent shells out to git). One reserve-reason with NODE_OPTIONS: the
 *    process still IS the real CLI, from the real location, and the table showed "a path".
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY *NOT* HERE — `PATH`, and every ordinary application variable. Approving
 * `PATH=./bin` is a COHERENT consent: "this project's terminals resolve tools from the repo" is the
 * feature's stated purpose, and the hijack it enables still requires committing a visible binary
 * that a reviewer can see in the tree. `NODE_OPTIONS` fails exactly that test, which is why it sits
 * above and PATH does not — it smuggles execution into a binary the user believes untouched.
 *
 * The reserved list exists only for keys whose implications a dialog CANNOT convey — a credential
 * directory, a silent traffic redirect, a hook identity, an interpreter preload — where what is
 * shown ("a path", "a URL", "a flag") and what is granted are different things. The line is
 * legibility, not danger; a project that wants its own auth belongs in a custom agent.
 *
 * SCOPE, precisely: this filters the project's contribution — BOTH halves of it, the git-shared
 * document AND this machine's local overlay. That is broader than the hostile-input argument
 * strictly requires, and it is the deliberate trade: one rule is auditable where "reserved unless
 * it came from the overlay" would be a provenance check on every key, at the spawn, forever.
 *
 * The same overreach applies by AGENT: `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is reserved for every pane, including a
 * plain terminal that launches no agent at all and where the opencode-plugin hazard cannot arise.
 * Kept anyway, for the same one-auditable-rule reason — the alternative is a per-agent reserved list
 * evaluated at the spawn, and a pane's agent can change under it. The honest cost: someone who
 * wanted to point a project's shells at repo-local dotfiles through project env cannot, and the
 * local overlay is no workaround because this filter covers that too. What is left is custom-agent
 * env (per-machine configuration the user typed themselves, merged after and over this) for an agent
 * pane, or the shell's own rc for a plain one.
 *
 * Filtered SILENTLY at the merge — a spawn is not a place to raise a second question. So a dropped
 * key is currently invisible to its author; surfacing the skipped keys in the project settings
 * panel is left to the observability wave.
