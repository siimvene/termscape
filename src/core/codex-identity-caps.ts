/**
 * "Can a node on THIS machine get a managed Codex identity?" — the construction-time half of the
 * fallback.
 *
 * Modelled on `core/claude-cli.ts`: one answer behind one CorePlatform RPC channel, registered by
 * BOTH shells, whose unknown answer is the conservative one. The renderer asks it before it writes
 * a launch line, and a `false` means the line stays the bare `codex` it has always been — never a
 * launcher path that might not resolve, which would be a dead node.
 *
 * It differs from claude's in WHERE the work happens: claude's probe is lazy and self-starting
 * (`claude --version` can run whenever someone first asks), while this one cannot compute anything
 * until the shell has handed the hook server its node-auth secret. So the shell PUSHES the answer
 * in (`refreshCodexIdentityCaps`) and a caller that arrives first WAITS for it — see
 * `codexIdentityCaps` below for why waiting, rather than answering "no", is the only safe default
 * here.
 *
 * FOUR things have to be true, and none is knowable from the renderer:
 *  1. the hook server holds the per-node auth secret (no secret ⇒ no capability token ⇒ the
 *     launcher would fall back anyway, one process later),
 *  2. the generated launcher could actually be written (a read-only or full data dir is a real
 *     failure mode, and it is the one the renderer cannot see at all),
 *  3. this INSTALL of codex can run a shared app-server at all — see
 *     `codexManagedRuntimeInstalled`. This is the precondition the first cut got wrong: it asked
 *     `--help` for a `--remote` flag, which an npm-installed codex 0.146.0 advertises perfectly
 *     happily while `codex app-server daemon start` answers
 *
 *       Error: managed standalone Codex install not found at
 *       ~/.codex/packages/standalone/current/codex
 *
 *     So on the mainstream install channel we wrote `nodeterm-codex` into the launch line and only
 *     discovered at runtime that it could never work: a wasted curl round trip, a `plain codex`
 *     chip, and a warning banner on the first fallback of EVERY node, forever, for a feature that
 *     cannot function on that install. Noisily inert. Answered here it is genuinely inert, and
 *  4. the installed `codex` accepts `--remote` — see `codexCliSupportsRemote`. This is the only
 *     one that cannot be recovered from at runtime: the launcher's preflight proves that
 *     `codex app-server daemon start` exits 0, and then EXECS. A CLI with an app-server but no
 *     `--remote` dies on a clap usage error after that exec, where there is no fallback left. So
 *     it is answered here, once per app run, entirely off the launch path.
 *
 * SERVER EDITION: `src/server` registers the same async answer after arming its raw-0600 node
 * secret. The shared identity is core-owned and local on that host; no Electron primitive is
 * required.

/**
 * Can this install run a shared app-server? A STAT, and deliberately not `codex app-server daemon
 * start`.
 *
 * The three candidates, and why this one:
 *  - `codex app-server daemon start` is the authoritative answer, and it STARTS A DAEMON. This
 *    probe runs once per app run at boot, on every machine with codex installed, including the
 *    runs where no Codex node is ever opened. A capability probe must not create the very process
 *    the feature exists to create lazily.
 *  - `codex app-server daemon version` is read-only but connects to the control socket, so it
 *    fails on a perfectly capable install whose daemon merely is not running yet — i.e. after
 *    every boot. Fail-closed, but uselessly so: the probe runs ONCE, so it would pin the feature
 *    off for the session on the machines it is meant to be on.
 *  - `codex app-server daemon stop` prints the authoritative JSON (`managedCodexPath`,
 *    `managedCodexVersion`) and exits 0 even when nothing is running — but it stops a RUNNING
 *    daemon, which is the shared app-server every other node is attached to. Refused outright.
 *
 * So: the same fact, read the cheapest conclusive way, with no side effect and no spawn. Anything
 * we cannot establish — a relocated home, a permission error, a layout we do not recognise —
 * throws or misses and answers `false`, which is the bare `codex` this feature degrades to
 * everywhere else. A wrong "no" costs only the shared app-server; a wrong "yes" costs a round trip
 * and a banner on every node.

 * and an unrecognised flag does not degrade — it makes the CLI exit. Anchored on a word boundary
 * so `--remote-auth-token-env`, or prose mentioning the flag inside another option's description,
 * cannot answer yes for it.
 *
 * Absent help output ⇒ false ⇒ no shared identity ⇒ the bare `codex` command, exactly as before
 * this feature. That is the same direction every other unknown in this file degrades in: a wrong
