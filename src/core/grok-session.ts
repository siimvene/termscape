// Reads what nodeterm needs from a grok session DIRECTORY. Grok's hook envelope carries no
// transcript path (claude's does), but every event carries `cwd` and `sessionId` — and grok stores
// a session at `$GROK_HOME/sessions/<url-encoded cwd>/<id>/`. So the directory is DERIVED, never
// searched, and this module only ever reads inside a directory a hook told us about.
//
// Contents, MEASURED on 1.0.13 across 29 local sessions (2026-09-02) — the previous version of this
// comment called `updates.jsonl` the "authoritative conversation log" and `chat_history.jsonl` "raw
// model messages", which is backwards where it matters and is the single most expensive false claim
// in this integration: it sends a reader to build against the file that cannot be read message by
// message.
//
//   summary.json        `generated_title`, `session_summary`, `current_model_id`, `info`,
//                       timestamps, counts.
//   signals.json        the context meter's numbers — `contextTokensUsed`, `contextWindowTokens`
//                       and grok's own `contextWindowUsage` — plus 63 unrelated metrics.
//   chat_history.jsonl  THE CONVERSATION, one settled message per line (`system`, `user`,
//                       `assistant`, `tool_result`, `backend_tool_call`, `reasoning`). This is what
//                       context links, the ⌘M panel and cross-agent transfer read.
//   updates.jsonl       the ACP event STREAM (`session/update` notifications). It is not empty of
//                       conversation — `agent_message_chunk`, `user_message_chunk` and
//                       `agent_thought_chunk` are in there — but it carries CHUNKS interleaved with
//                       `tool_call`/`tool_call_update`, `hook_execution`, `plan`, compaction and
//                       subagent events, so reading a message out of it means reassembling it.
//                       `chat_history.jsonl` is the same conversation already settled.
//
// The trap: grok's hook payloads advertise `updates.jsonl` as the transcript path, so following the
// advertisement is the obvious move and it fails SILENTLY — a real file opens, our line parser finds
// no `type` field on any line, and the caller gets an empty transcript with nothing logged.
//
// This is grok's reader, and `transcript-reader.ts` stays claude's: a "shared" reader that knows two
// storage layouts is two readers in a trench coat, and the one thing neither must ever do is search
// the other's tree. The choice is made once, at the IPC handler.

 * key ever appears in `summary.json`. Grok does not distinguish a manual title from a generated one
 * the way claude's `custom-title` / `ai-title` pair does.
 *
 * `'title'` stays first as forward compatibility: a key absent from every file costs one failed
 * lookup and can never produce a wrong name. If a future grok splits the two, a manual title wins.
 *
 * `session_summary` is the fallback for a session too young to have `generated_title` yet. Measured
 * across 49 local summary.json files (1.0.13): 20 of them carry `session_summary` and no
 * `generated_title`; where both exist they are identical in 28 of 29; the longest value in the
 * corpus is 49 characters. It is accepted only under SESSION_SUMMARY_TITLE_MAX: a longer value is
 * **refused, not truncated**, because this result is adopted as the node title with no other length
 * cap on the path (header, sidebar, kanban card, window title, project.json). Null is the node
 * keeping its own name; a truncated sentence is a wrong name.
