 * Tests that want their own directory still pass one in; this only fixes what they inherit.
 *
 * The directory is made on first READ, not at construction, and under the run's own root
 * (`FAKE_PLATFORM_ROOT_ENV`). Made eagerly in the system temp dir and never removed, it leaked one
 * directory per call — including every call whose test passes its own `userDataDir` or never reads
 * it — and a development server running the suite repeatedly collected ~395,000 of them until
