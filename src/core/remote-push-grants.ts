// SSH-possession push grants that live on a REMOTE host (the Mac → SSH-host topology).
//
// `push-grants.ts` reads `~/.nodeterm/push-grants` on the machine that owns the agent-status
// mirror. That is the whole story when the phone and the mirror owner are the same box (a headless
// Server Edition the phone SSHes into). It is NOT the story for the common desktop setup:
//
//   phone --SSH--> Linux dev host <--SSH-- macOS nodeterm (owns the canvas, the hooks, the mirror)
//
// There the phone drops its grant on the HOST — the only machine it can reach — while the process
// that has something to push runs on the Mac and scans only its own `$HOME`. Result: an SSH-only
// user gets no push at all, and no error anywhere (`resolveTarget` just returns null: no paired
// phone, no grants). The remote read-acks already had their counterpart sweep
// (`SshProjectManager.sweepRemoteAcks`); grants did not. This module is that missing half.
//
// It stays pure + electron-free (`src/core`): the ssh execution is injected, so the command is
// unit-testable and the cache's dead-mark lifecycle is testable without a host. Tolerant of junk
// at every step, exactly like `push-grants.ts` — a phone mid-write must never break a sweep.

/**
 * One host's grant listing, as ONE literal `sh` line (no interpolation — nothing from a host or a
 * project id is ever spliced in). Prints `<deviceId>\t<json>` per grant file:
 *
 *   - `[ -e "$f" ] || break` handles the no-glob case (the pattern stays literal when nothing
 *     matches) — same idiom as the ack sweep.
 *   - `tr -d '\r\n'` flattens the JSON to one line so the reply is line-parseable; a pretty-printed
 *     or CRLF file still parses.
 *   - `cut -c1-4096` bounds a junk/huge file. A truncation yields invalid JSON, which the parser
 *     skips — the tolerant outcome, not a crash.
 *
 * Read-only: unlike the ack sweep, grants are NOT consumed. A grant is re-usable until the phone
 * re-mints it (and the backend is what actually validates it).

 * under host 1's grant, and the backend consulted host 1's mute for a host 2 event: a host the user
 * had turned OFF kept ringing (issue #435). Both grants now survive, tagged with their host, and
 * `push-notify` routes each node's events to its own host's grant — one push per event, under the
