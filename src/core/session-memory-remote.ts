// The SSH leg of session memory: an SSH project's sessions live on the HOST, so the sweep must

// ControlMaster, and only the printed sections come back — the same division of labour as
// remote-claude-usage.ts (core owns the command AND the parsing; the shell owns the master).
//
// One round trip carries all three facts, because each extra `ssh` exec is a login on someone
// else's machine.

 * The generated command. Notes that are load-bearing:
 *  - Every section header is printed unconditionally, so a MISSING one means the read was cut
 *    short (dead master, killed mid-stream) rather than "the host had nothing".
 *  - The headers are QUOTED. `echo ##MEM` prints an EMPTY LINE: an unquoted `#` at the start of a
 *    word begins a comment in POSIX sh, so the marker is eaten by the shell and every report comes
 *    back `ok:false`. Measured under dash. Do not drop the quotes. (`"${SOCKRC} $?"` is
 *    double-quoted for the same reason AND so `$?` still expands.)
 *  - Each socket gets its OWN fence, and its tmux stderr is folded into the fence (`2>&1`) rather
 *    than thrown away. This is the remote counterpart of the local leg's `isNoServerError`: the
 *    exit status alone cannot tell "there is no tmux server on this socket" (an ANSWER, and the
 *    normal state of a socket nobody has used) from "the tmux client is broken / the socket dir
 *    belongs to another uid / the server hung" (NOT an answer). The previous form —
 *    `{ tmux …; tmux …; } || true` with stderr discarded — collapsed both into an empty section,
 *    so a host running thirty sessions with a broken tmux reported `{ok:true, rows:[]}` and the
 *    panel said "No sessions are running here."
 *  - Nothing after a socket's own line can fail the script: `$?` is consumed by the very next
 *    `echo`, so the command still exits 0 for the shell's exit-code gate.
 *  - The socket names and the `-F` format come from the shared constants, so the remote sweep can
 *    never look at a different socket, or ask for different fields, than the local one.
 *  - `ps -eo pid,ppid,rss` is used even on Linux hosts: it is one process instead of thousands of
 *    /proc reads over a link we do not control, and its output is what we already parse.
