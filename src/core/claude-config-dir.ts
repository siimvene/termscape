// Resolve a Claude account's config dir under this app's persistent state root — or, for a LINKED
// account, the pre-existing dir the user already owns (`ClaudeAccount.configDir`).
// The account LIST + login lifecycle live in main/claude-accounts.ts; this is just the
// impure path resolution (needs the platform seam for userDataDir) split out so core
// modules (pty-manager, etc.) can use it without importing electron.
//
// The linked half needs the account LIST, which core does not own — the settings store lives in
// each shell. So each shell REGISTERS a getter at boot (`registerClaudeAccountsSource`) and every
// account-aware reader keeps calling the one resolver it already called. One registration point
// rather than threading the list through pty-manager, the usage service, the transcript readers
// and both jails: a second copy of "where does this account's config live?" is exactly the drift
// CLAUDE.md warns about, and the answer moved for linked accounts.
