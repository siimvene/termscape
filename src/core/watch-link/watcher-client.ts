// A live link watcher's OWN tmux client — the one it spawns when no Session is held for the node
// (after an app restart, for a closed project, for a released node). Pure: argv builders and parsers.
//
// The owner's spelling for a client, `new-session -A`, is wrong here in three ways, each measured on
// tmux 3.4 (watcher-client.realtty.test.ts):
//  - SIZE. Under tmux's default `window-size latest` the newest client sets the window size: a watcher
//    at 40x10 shrank the owner's 120x39 window to 40x9 — a SIGWINCH to the agent running there, because
//    somebody opened a link. With `-f ignore-size` the window stayed at 120x39 and the owner's client as
//    it was — BUT only because the owner was attached: tmux 3.4 honours `ignore-size` only while at least
//    one client WITHOUT the flag is attached to some session on the same server. A watcher that is the
//    only client sizes the window like any other (measured: spawned at 40x10 alone → window 40x10; spawned
//    at 120x40, an owner joins at 200x50 and leaves → the window snaps back to 120x40). So the client is
//    spawned at the window's CURRENT size, read just before the spawn, and refused when that read fails
//    (`PtyManager.spawnNew`); `PtyManager.syncWatcherClientSize` keeps it at the window's size while the
//    link has viewers. Residual: drift for up to one sync interval, and a read racing an owner's resize
//    or departure (the window then keeps the size read a moment before).
//  - ENVIRONMENT. Attaching runs `update-environment`, which copies every listed name from the attaching
//    client's env into the session and STRIPS the ones that client lacks — the account scope
//    (CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR, …, CLAUDE.md #419) included. `-E` skips it; the session env is untouched.
//  - CREATION. `new-session -A` creates when the session is gone, so a session that died between the
//    strict existence verdict and the spawn would be re-created bare, by a viewer. `attach-session`
//    never creates: it exits 1 ("can't find session") and nothing appears.
// `read-only` is a belt: nothing is ever written into a watcher's pty, and if something were, tmux
// drops input from a read-only client.
//
// The target is exact, `=nt-<id>:` (a bare name prefix-matches another node's session; measured, see
// capture-route.ts). For attach-session both `=name` and `=name:` are exact; `=name:` is kept so every
// watch-link target is spelled one way.
//
// Client flags (`-f`) need tmux 3.2. Locally the version is probed (`supportsWatcherClient`) and an
// older or unreadable one refuses the watcher; over SSH the remote tmux rejects the flags itself.
