// A viewer's chat reaches the owner ONLY through a live link's own relay session: the cast arrives on
// that session's `PeerAttach.cast`, which the link host answers (link-host.ts), after the watcher
// policy admitted it for a Commenter or Control link only (watcher-policy.ts). Nothing registers `watch:chat` on
// a platform. If something did, a hosted Editor or a Server Edition browser tab — clients of the same
// core, whose casts go to the platform — could post "viewer" chat into the owner's popover, and a
// Viewer link's refusal would no longer be the only door.
//
// So this names every file allowed to mention the cast, and fails on any other, with its reason. The
// event of the same name (`WATCH_EVENT.chat`, host → viewer) is the same string, so a handler
// registered under it would be the same door: it is matched too, and only the link host writes it.
