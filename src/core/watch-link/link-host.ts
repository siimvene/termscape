// One live link at runtime: its standing relay listeners (one hosted-scheduler, capped at
// MAX_VIEWERS_PER_LINK bridged), and for every connected viewer a relay-host session whose peer key
// must be the one derived from the link secret. The viewer is attached as a QUIET, SELF-PACED core
// client; the host joins the node's RUNNING session on its behalf (join-only, never a size vote,
// every argument built from the host's own records — nothing comes from the viewer), sends meta and a
// visible-screen keyframe, then streams through the watcher sink (watcher-policy.ts).
//
// THE VIEWER'S INBOUND SURFACE IS ENFORCED HERE, on the host. The relay-host `access` hook
// (watcherAccess) refuses every request and every cast but chat (Commenter and Control links) and
// unlock / input / release (Control links), and this module's own `PeerAttach` is the second layer:
// it forwards nothing to any platform, and a request, or a cast the link's role does not admit, that
// reaches it anyway means the access policy failed, so the session is CLOSED (fail closed, as
// relay-host does for a throwing wrapSink). Input from a viewer that is not controlling is the same
// breach (but for the GRACE below). No viewer size or resize reaches a pty; the only viewer bytes that
// reach anything are a controller's input, into the pane of the session the host joined (TYPING
// below). The join, the size sync, the capture and the input take only ids the host chose. No
// `interceptReq` is ever supplied (it would bypass `access`).
//
// CONTROL (a Control link, role 'controller') is per CONNECTION: a viewer that unlocks with the link's
// password (`watch:unlock`) is `controlling` until it releases, disconnects or is kicked, or until the
// owner turns control off or changes the password, or the link locks; a reconnect unlocks again. The
// record is the service's: the host READS `record.control` live and never writes it (the service sets
// `locked` inside `onControlLocked`, before it returns). An unlock is answered to that viewer alone
// (`watch:control`), and every throttle is here: one attempt per UNLOCK_MIN_INTERVAL_MS per viewer and
// one verification in flight per link (both `too-soon`, not counted); a malformed attempt counts as
// wrong and is never verified, so an over-long password never reaches scrypt; WRONG_PER_CONN wrong
// attempts end that connection (`attempts`), WRONG_PER_LINK across the link lock it. The link count is
// the record's: the host starts from `record.control.wrong` and reports every new count to the service
// (`onWrongAttempt`), which writes it — an app restart does not reset it. `allowControl` and a password
// change reset it. A verification is re-checked after its await: an
// ended viewer, a stopped host, or any change to control meanwhile (off, locked, a new password — the
// control epoch) voids it, uncounted. A join whose input route is `none` (Zellij, an unknown session;
// also what a missing or unknown route reads as) makes that viewer's state `off`/`unsupported`: its
// meta says so, an unlock is answered so (uncounted), and a controller is demoted.
//
// TYPING (`watch:input` from a controller). A cast whose data is not a string of 1..INPUT_MAX units is a
// breach. A terminal's own answer to the pane's query (`isTerminalReport`: DA, CPR, a colour — every
// controller's emulator answers every query) is dropped, uncounted. Then the connection's own token
// bucket (INPUT_RATE / INPUT_BURST, UTF-8 bytes), a session to type into, and a batch the panes have
// not taken yet holding at most INPUT_BURST decide; dropped input still goes through the splitter's
// `discard` (a paste any part of which was dropped is discarded whole), and the viewer is told
// `{controlling, dropped}` at most once per DROPPED_NOTICE_MIN_MS. A batch holds at most
// INPUT_CHUNKS_MAX chunks (each chunk is one pane delivery — a tmux spawn — and a paste/keys alternation
// would otherwise cost one per chunk): past it, the rest of THAT batch is dropped in whole chunks, the
// same way and with the same notice. Accepted data goes through the
// connection's SPLITTER (control-input.ts: keys vs a bracketed paste) into its BATCH; the batch flushes
// INPUT_BATCH_MS after its first input into ONE flush CHAIN per link host, through `pty.input`
// (PtyManager's pane delivery, never a tmux client's key table). A connection has at most one batch in
// the chain: while it waits there, new input keeps collecting, so a slow pane coalesces input instead
// of piling up deliveries. ORDER: a connection's input reaches the pane in the order it was typed, and
// every batch arrives whole (no other controller's chunk inside it); ACROSS controllers it is roughly
// flush order — a connection whose previous batch is still in the chain re-enters only when that batch
// finishes, behind whatever other controllers flushed meanwhile. Each chunk is re-checked before it
// goes — same control period (`controlGen`, bumped by every loss of control), still controlling,
// still the session it was typed at. The same check rides the chunk as a predicate (`isCurrent`), which
// PtyManager asks right before the step spawns: a chunk handed over and still waiting in its per-session
// chain (behind a slow step) never lands after its sender stopped controlling. A false, a rejection, or
// no answer within
// INPUT_DELIVERY_TIMEOUT_MS stops the batch with the `dropped` notice (an SSH host without tmux answers
// false on every chunk: never silence) and the chain moves on. Input is never held for a later
// session: a session that ends drops the pending batch and discards an open paste (told either way).
// The typing set names a controller by the name it unlocked under, not a later chat name. Nothing
// typed is ever logged.
//
// GRACE. Keystrokes are in flight when control ends (a release, the owner turning typing off, a new
// password, the lock, a join whose terminal cannot take input — every one of them goes through
// `loseControl`): input from a connection that stopped
// controlling within INPUT_GRACE_MS is dropped silently — not delivered, not counted, not a breach.
// From a connection that never controlled, or later than that, it is a breach as before.
//
// THE TYPING SET: the names with accepted input in the last TYPING_WINDOW_MS. It is recomputed at
// most once per TYPING_EVENT_MIN_MS while anyone is in it (which is also what clears it), sent as
// `watch:typing` to every joined viewer when the SET changes (a new order alone is no news), and to a
// viewer right after its meta on every (re)join while it is not empty — otherwise a viewer that
// reconnects mid-typing would never learn it. A connection that loses control or ends leaves it at
// once (the event follows within a tick).
//
// relay-host never tells us about ends it caused itself (`deny`, `close`): every such path goes
// through `ended()`, which reports to the scheduler exactly once (the hosted-service pattern).
//
// THE STREAM. The watcher's filter (stream-filter.ts) starts MID-STREAM on every join: a viewer
// co-attaches to a running session and its first byte may fall inside an OSC 52. Frames that arrive
// before `c.sessionId` is known never reach the filter at all (the wrapper needs the session id), so
// a join can never start in text mode. A mid-stream filter swallows text until the first escape; the
// join keyframe is sent at once, and if the filter had not settled by then ONE follow-up keyframe is
// taken when it does (`onSettled`), plus one at SETTLE_BOUND_MS after the join if it still has not
// (controller ruling R23). The filter is never reset to text mode to "unstick" it: inside a string
// that would print the string's payload.
//
// KEYFRAMES are a visible-only capture (never history) passed through a FRESH text-mode filter (a
// capture starts in ground state, and `capture-pane -e` emits OSC 8 verbatim — R9), with the host's
// cursor when it was read (R10) and `altScreen` from the join (a tmux client paints on the alternate
// screen — R18). One capture per session is in flight at a time, shared by this link's viewers of
// that session (R27): a JOIN keyframe may share a capture already running (that viewer has forwarded
// nothing of this session, so an earlier screen cannot paint over newer output it showed), any other
// keyframe needs a capture STARTED after it asked. A per-viewer sequence makes sure an older result
// is never painted after a newer one, and streaming resumes only on the newest.
//
// NO CAPTURE IS NOT AN EMPTY SCREEN (R36). A backend with no visible-only capture (the Windows session
// host, a direct Windows pty, a plain shell) and a capture that failed answer `unavailable`, and then
// NO keyframe is sent: the viewer paints a keyframe as reset + clear, so an empty one would erase what
// the stream had drawn. The viewer follows the stream instead (at the join it still gets meta), and a
// throttled viewer resumes streaming without a repaint. Residual: on such a backend a throttled
// viewer shows gaps until the application repaints them.
//
// SIZE. A viewer never sizes anything. Its meta carries the joined session's CURRENT size (R25). A
// watcher's OWN tmux client (spawned when no owner Session is held) attaches with `ignore-size`, but
// tmux honours that only while some client WITHOUT the flag is attached to the server (measured,
// tmux 3.4): when the watcher is the only client, tmux's `window-size latest` sizes the window to it.
// So `syncSize` (PtyManager.syncWatcherClientSize, serialized per session there — R24) keeps that
// client at the window's size: before every keyframe capture (the screen then matches the size) and
// every WATCHER_SIZE_SYNC_MS while this link has a joined viewer. Residual: when the watcher becomes the
// only client, the window stays at the last-synced size until another client sizes it (an owner resize
// in the last interval before leaving is not caught).
//
// SPLIT PANES: a keyframe captures the session's ACTIVE pane only (`=nt-<id>:`); the stream, which is
// the tmux client's own output, repairs the rest as tmux redraws it.
//
// BACKLOG. A watcher is self-paced (the registry never pauses or drops for it), so it bounds its own
// backlog: pty frames stop at WATCHER_BUFFER_LIMIT (watcher-policy), chat is skipped for a viewer that
// far behind, and past VIEWER_BACKLOG_CLOSE the viewer's session is closed (R28): a socket that never
// drains must not grow the host's memory. meta, keyframe, waiting and end are small and rare.
//
// REJOIN. A session that ends (exit, closed, recycled, or found gone after a join or a capture — R30)
// sends the viewer `watch:waiting` and rejoins on a backoff. A join that is REFUSED (no session it may
// join) also marks the viewer `waiting` for the OWNER (`LinkViewer.waiting`, R63): on a backend with no
// watcher client of its own (Windows' session host, no local tmux, Zellij) only a terminal this app has
// open can be watched, and the owner is the one who can open it — a LIVE chip alone would say nothing. The backoff is reset only once a joined
// session stayed up for REJOIN_STABLE_MS from its join keyframe (R26), never on a join or a lifecycle
// event: an old remote tmux that rejects the client flags, or an owner's repeated `-D`, attaches then
// exits at once, and resetting on success turned that into a spawn + read + capture every 2 s forever.
//
// Nothing here throws out of a callback or a void promise: relay-host calls into this module from a
// socket's message emit and from the trust gate's async settle, where a throw is lost or unhandled.
