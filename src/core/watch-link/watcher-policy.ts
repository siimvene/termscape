// The `watcher` relay role, as two RelayHostHooks pieces. It deliberately does NOT go through
// access-policy.ts's `decideAccess`: that function evaluates any non-editor role against the whole
// VIEW table (files, git, presence, board log), and a live link may reach none of it.
//  - Inbound: every request and cast is refused, except the chat cast on a Commenter or Control
//    link, and the unlock / input / release casts on a Control link. The policy knows only the role:
//    whether THIS viewer may type (it unlocked with the link's password) is the link host's
//    per-connection state, and the link host refuses input from a viewer that is not controlling.
//  - Outbound, deny by default too: `watch:*` events, this viewer's own pty data frames (filtered,
//    paced) and its session's `pty:size`, nothing else. Every broadcast is dropped (a second layer:
//    the watcher is also a QUIET client, absent from broadcast() and clientIds()).
//    - `pty:exit` / `pty:closed` / `pty:recycled` are CONSUMED (`onLifecycle`, which answers with
//      `watch:waiting`) and never forwarded: `pty:closed` carries `{by: ClientId}`, which identifies
//      another client of this core.
//    - `pty:resync` is refused. Its payload is the registry's default capture, which is history on
//      the SSH and session-host paths and carries OSC 8 verbatim; a watcher repaints only through
//      `watch:keyframe` (a visible-only capture passed through a fresh filter). The registry never
//      resyncs a self-paced client anyway; this is the second layer.
//    The viewer page reads `pty:size` and nothing else among pty events.
