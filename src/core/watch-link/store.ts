// Active live links survive an app restart (spec D8). The secret is sealed through the platform's
// secret seam: Electron safeStorage on the desktop, and ABSENT on the Server Edition by design
// (headless, no keychain: raw bytes in a 0600 file, the same rule as its node secrets). On the
// desktop there is no plaintext fallback: if sealing throws, a link that was never sealed is not
// written (it lives in memory for this run; see R45 below for the ones that were); a raw secret found
// on a desktop is refused, never adopted.
//
// What is sealed is the BASE64 TEXT of the secret, never its bytes. The desktop seam is a string
// seam (`safeStorage.encryptString(b.toString('utf8'))` / `Buffer.from(decryptString(b), 'utf8')`),
// so 32 random bytes — almost never valid UTF-8 — come back as different bytes of a different
// length. Same convention as src/core/agents/node-auth-secret.ts. Unsealed entries (Server Edition)
// are the base64 of the raw bytes.
//
// The store never writes over a file it could not read. Only ENOENT means "no links". Any other
// read error, a file over 1 MiB, or a version other than 1 makes `load()` reject and LATCHES the
// store: every later `save()` resolves 'failed' without touching disk, so the file survives for the
// next boot or a newer build. JSON that does not parse is set aside as `<file>.corrupt-<ts>` and the
// store starts empty; if the set-aside fails, the same latch applies.
//
// Loads and saves are SERIALIZED, in call order, on one chain: each waits for the previous one to
// settle. Two overlapping atomic writes can still complete out of order, and the older snapshot would
// then be what stays on disk — a revoked link resurrected at the next boot. And a save issued while a
// load is still reading must not run before that load's verdict: it would write over a file the load
// is about to refuse (a slow EACCES/EIO, a newer build's version), or land between reading a corrupt
// file and setting it aside. The snapshot is taken (and sealed) when `save` is CALLED, so disk order
// is call order; a failed load or write never breaks the chain for what follows.
//
// OPAQUE ENTRIES (controller ruling R42). A sealed secret the keychain REFUSES to unseal this run
// (locked at login, or reset) says nothing about whether the link is gone: the next run may unseal it.
// So such an entry is kept exactly as it was read — never returned by `load()` (nothing can host a
// link without its secret), never erased by a `save()` — and carried back verbatim on every write
// until its own `expiresAt` passes; the first write after that drops it. A sealed secret that unseals
// but is malformed, and a raw secret found on a desktop, are not opaque: they are dropped as before.
// `discardOpaque()` is for "Stop all", whose server revoke has ended every link of the license.
//
// A KEYCHAIN THAT STOPS SEALING MID-RUN (controller ruling R45). The store keeps the sealed form of
// every secret it read or sealed this run and reuses it on every write (it never re-seals), so when
// `seal` starts throwing only a link it NEVER sealed is left out (reported 'memory-only'); links read
// at boot and links sealed earlier stay on disk, and a link no longer in the list is still dropped.
//
// A CONTROL LINK (role 'controller') carries `control`: whether typing is on, the password's scrypt
// salt and hash (./password.ts — never the plaintext), whether wrong attempts locked it, and the
// link-wide count of wrong attempts toward that lock (`wrong`, 0..CONTROL_WRONG_MAX — persisted, so an
// app restart does not hand an attacker who holds the link fresh guesses; a file written before the
// count existed reads as 0). It is
// written as it is, not sealed: the hash is scrypt'd, and anyone who can read this 0600 file under
// userData is already this user. `control` is present IFF the role is 'controller', and a load drops
// any entry that breaks that rule: a hand-edited file cannot give a viewer link a password, and a
// controller link with no password is not a link this build can host. A save refuses ('failed', the
// file untouched) a list holding such a record: it would be written only for the next load to drop it.
//
// AN UNLIMITED LINK has `expiresAt: null`: it lives until it is stopped. An opaque one is carried
// until it is discarded, never dropped for time.
