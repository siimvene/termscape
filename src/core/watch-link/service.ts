// The live-link registry (docs/live-links.md): the owner's side of every link this machine hosts —
// at most MAX_LINKS_PER_MACHINE, each with its link host (link-host.ts). Records are persisted
// (spec D8) and resumed at launch. Owner state goes to OWNER clients only (`sendToOwners`): every
// view carries the link's URL, and the URL carries the secret.
//
// A LINK ENDS on: the owner's Stop (`revoke`, no notice — the owner did it), Stop all (`revokeAll`,
// one server call, awaited and reported — it is what reaches other machines' links), its expiry (a timer, plus a re-check on every host change because timers are
// monotonic and a closed lid pauses them — G24), the node leaving every project, or the server saying
// it is gone (a mint or status answering 410 — `onGone`, which does raise a notice).
//
// NODE GONE IS TRI-STATE (controller ruling R40). `nodeState` answers present / absent / unknown, and
// only ABSENT ends a link and revokes it server-side: an empty answer during the launch-time workspace
// load, or for a node in a project whose file was not read this run, is not evidence the node is gone,
// and a revoke cannot be undone. `init()` first waits for the workspace load it is handed, then keeps
// (and hosts) a link whose node is unknown — its join is join-only, so a node that never comes back
// costs a waiting viewer, never a spawned session. Create requires PRESENT. The same check runs before
// every join (R29): the link host is registry-free, so the registry wraps its `pty.join`.
//
// PERSISTENCE never blocks the owner (Task 9 note B, spec revoke order). Ending a link removes the
// record and ISSUES the write (the store snapshots at call time) before the sessions end, and never
// waits for it before the server revoke: a disk that hangs must not keep a revoked link's viewers
// connected or its server row alive. A create does wait for its write (a link that cannot be
// written must not exist: the server row is revoked), but no longer than PERSIST_TIMEOUT_MS.
// A links file that could not be read (WatchLinkStoreUnreadable) turns this run MEMORY-ONLY: the
// store is latched and never written, links still work and end at quit, and the owner is told on
// every create (R22, R42c). A keychain that refuses to SEAL is narrower (R45): the store still writes
// every link it holds a sealed form of — read at boot or sealed earlier this run — so only a link that
// was never sealed (the one just created) is not saved; it answers memory-only, and the owner is told.
// `init()` writes only when it actually pruned something (R42a), so a boot never rewrites the file.
//
// ENTITLEMENT. A host never mints with an empty entitlement (the API would answer 400, which stops
// minting for good): it answers itself a local refusal, and `onEntitlementChanged` re-arms every host
// the API refused once the license layer reports a change — a 7-day token expiring under a running
// link is the ordinary case (R41).
//
// CONTROL LINKS (role 'controller'). The password is checked by `controlPasswordProblem` and hashed
// (scrypt, ./password.ts) BEFORE the server row is created, so a hash that fails creates nothing; only
// {salt, hash} is kept, never the plaintext, and nothing logged carries the password, the hash or the
// salt. Every scrypt run of this process — the hosts' unlock checks and the owner's new passwords — goes
// through ONE FIFO gate of SCRYPT_SLOTS (each run is ~32 MiB and ~80 ms on libuv's 4-thread pool, and
// unlock attempts arrive from strangers): a run waits for a slot, it is never refused. The lock the
// link host asks for (`onControlLocked`) is set on the record synchronously — the host reads the record
// live — and is never undone by a failed write. So is the link-wide count of wrong attempts the host
// reports (`onWrongAttempt`): it goes on the record and is written, at most WRONG_PER_LINK writes per
// link (the last rides the lock's), so an app restart does not reset it; a new password and Allow
// control again reset it. The owner's changes go by DIRECTION. One that NARROWS access (typing off, a
// new password) is the owner's brake: it reaches the record and the host at once — a leaked password or
// an unwanted typist must not wait on the disk — and is NEVER undone: a write that fails or does not
// answer within PERSIST_TIMEOUT_MS answers 'unsaved' (in force now, undone by a restart unless a later
// write lands — every write carries the whole list from memory, so the next one that lands saves it;
// Stop ends it for good). One that WIDENS it (typing on, allow again) is written first, from a copy of
// the record, and reaches the record and the host only once that write landed: nobody can unlock and
// type during a write the owner is then told failed, which answers false. The owner is never told a
// change was kept that the next launch would not have. A later change to the same field supersedes an
// earlier one still being written (its late apply is skipped).
//
// AN UNLIMITED LINK (`ttlSeconds` 0) has `expiresAt: null`: no expiry timer, no expiry check on a host
// change, never pruned for time at launch. It ends like any link otherwise, and when its owner's Pro
// lapses the server refuses its host-token mint (402) — the host stops minting and the view says
// `refused`, the same state as any refused mint.
//
// THE SERVER EDITION registers this same service with `unsupported: true` until it has a license layer
// (R43): create answers `unsupported`, list answers [], nothing is loaded, hosted or revoked. The same
// mode is what a Server Edition that does not own its data dir would need (G15).
//
// Nothing here throws out of a callback or a void promise; every timer is cleared by `end`/`shutdown`.
