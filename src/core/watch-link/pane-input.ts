// LIVE LINK CONTROL: a controller's typed bytes reach the node's PANE, never a tmux CLIENT.
//
// Why a pane and not a client. Writing into a tmux client's pty — the owner's painter, or the
// watcher's own `attach-session` client — makes tmux read the bytes as that client's KEYBOARD:
// they go through its key tables, so `C-b s` opens the session chooser and every other session on
// the server is one keystroke away (`C-b s`, `j`, Enter). A watcher's own client is also read-only
// and would drop every byte. So keys are injected into the pane with `send-keys -H`, which tmux
// hands to the pane as `KEYC_LITERAL` bytes (`cmd-send-keys.c` → `window_pane_key` →
// `input_key`: "Literal keys go as themselves"), with no client and no key table involved — the
// same command the background-write path already types with (`encodeSendKeysHex`).
//
// THE TWO PLANS
//  - keys  → `tmux -L <socket> source-file -`, the command TEXT on stdin:
//        if-shell -F -t =nt-x: '#{pane_in_mode}' 'copy-mode -q -t =nt-x:'
//        send-keys -t =nt-x: -H 1b 5b 41
//    `source-file -` keeps every typed byte (a password typed into the shell, say) off every
//    command line, local and SSH. The mode cancel comes first because `send-keys` into a pane in a
//    mode does NOT reach the app: copy mode dispatches its own key table, and tree mode (`C-b s`
//    opened by the owner) handles the keys itself — `j` then Enter would switch the owner's
//    client to another session. `copy-mode -q` leaves ANY mode, not just copy mode.
//  - paste → the paste plan `sendText` already uses (`load-buffer -` from stdin, the same mode
//    cancel, `paste-buffer -d -p -r`), with the text `sanitizePasteText`-ed, and NO Enter: tmux
//    frames it only when the pane's app asked for bracketed paste (`-p`), `-r` keeps `\n`.
//
// WHY NOT `paste-buffer` FOR EVERYTHING (the spec's first candidate). tmux 3.7 passes paste buffer
// CONTENT through vis(3) (issue #453), so an ESC byte arrives as the two characters `^[`: an arrow
// key arrives as the text `^[[A`, and Ctrl-C as `^C` (measured below, row x and 4e). Keys must never
// ride a paste buffer.
//
// MEASURED (2026-10-04, Linux, private socket + private TMUX_TMPDIR, conf = `set -g prefix C-b`;
// tmux 3.4 = /usr/bin/tmux, tmux 3.7b = the release the macOS app bundles, sha256-pinned, built
// from source). The pane ran `stty raw -echo -iexten; cat > file`, i.e. the file is exactly what the
// app's stdin received. SSH was NOT measured over a real ssh (no key for `ssh localhost` on the
// measuring host); the remote command line is proven under a real /bin/sh in
// pane-input.realtmux.test.ts instead.

// the next one), which is harmless here because every line names the same exact target.
// Version floors: `source-file -` needs tmux 3.1 (CHANGES 3.0a→3.1); an older SSH host fails the
// keys plan closed (exit 1). `copy-mode -q` is 3.2+ per the plan; untested below 3.4.
// Read from tmux's source (window.c `window_pane_key`), not measured: `send-keys` honours a window's
// `synchronize-panes` (the keys are copied to its other panes) and silently drops input to a pane
// disabled with `select-pane -d` while still exiting 0. nodeterm's conf sets neither.
