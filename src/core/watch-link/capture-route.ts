// A live link's KEYFRAME: the visible screen of a node's session, never the history above it.
//
// Pure: no tmux, no ssh, no PtyManager. `PtyManager.captureVisible` runs the argv built here (locally,
// or over the ControlMaster through `remoteCaptureVisibleArgs`) and parses the reply here.
//
// Which backend gets one (`visibleCaptureRoute`): the session host's capture is ~200 lines of
// scrollback and a direct Windows pane has no visible-only read, so both get NO keyframe (the viewer
// starts from the live stream) rather than history. A plain shell has no tmux to ask, and neither has
// a Zellij session (the optional local backend, zellij-backend.ts).
//
// The screen and the cursor are read in ONE tmux invocation (`capture-pane … ; display-message …`), so
// both describe the same instant: a cursor read in a second round trip could describe a screen that has
// since scrolled.
//
// The target is EXACT (`capturePaneTarget`). Node ids end in a counter, so `nt-x-1` is a prefix of
// `nt-x-12`, and tmux resolves a bare target by fnmatch then PREFIX on a miss: a bare target would
// capture ANOTHER node's screen and send it to this link's viewers. Measured on tmux 3.4, with only
// `nt-x-12` alive:
//   capture-pane -t nt-x-1     → 12's screen, exit 0          (the trap)
//   capture-pane -t =nt-x-1    → "can't find pane", exit 1    (also for =nt-x-12: `=name` alone never
//                                                             resolves a target-PANE)
//   capture-pane -t =nt-x-1:   → "can't find session", exit 1
//   capture-pane -t =nt-x-12:  → 12's screen, exit 0          (exact AND resolves)
//   display-message -t =nt-x-1: → exit 0, every format EMPTY
// and the combined `capture-pane -t =nt-x-1: ; display-message …` stops at the failed capture: exit 1,
// nothing on stdout. So an exact miss is a failed command, which the caller reads as unavailable.

/**
 * What a visible-only capture returns: the screen and the cursor, read at one instant.
 *
 * Deliberately NO alternate-screen flag (controller ruling R18). A keyframe's `altScreen` is decided
 * by the CALLER from the join (a tmux-backed client ⇒ `true`), not from the capture: a watcher
 * co-attaches to the tmux CLIENT's output, and tmux paints its client on the alternate screen
 * whatever the pane's application does, so every `tmux`/`ssh`-route join means `altScreen: true`.
 * The pane's own `#{alternate_on}` (vim, a TUI) describes a different screen — a shell pane reads 0
 * while the stream is on the alternate screen — and mapping it into the keyframe would scroll every
 * tmux redraw into the viewer's history.
