// A live link controller's input before it reaches the pane: which bytes are KEYS (typed byte for
// byte, pane-input.ts's keys plan) and which are a PASTE (text tmux frames per the pane's own
// bracketed-paste state, `paste-buffer -p`), and who typed in the last few seconds. Pure: no timers,
// no I/O — the link host owns both (link-host.ts).
//
// THE SPLITTER. While controlling, the viewer page holds its xterm in bracketed-paste mode, so every
// paste arrives framed `ESC[200~ … ESC[201~` and the host can tell a paste from typing. Everything
// outside a frame is keys, which is also where every control byte belongs: tmux 3.7 passes paste
// buffer content through vis(3), so a Ctrl-C inside a paste would arrive as the text `^C`
// (pane-input.ts, measured). The splitter keeps state across pushes because the page splits a long
// input into casts of at most INPUT_MAX units, so a marker (or a surrogate pair) can straddle two.
//
// Four rules beyond "find the markers":
//  - A trailing PREFIX of the marker being looked for is held until the next push. A lone Esc is such
//    a prefix, and so is Alt+[ (`ESC [`) — the only two a single key press can end on — so `drain()`
//    hands exactly those over as keys, and the host calls it when it flushes a batch: an Esc reaches
//    the pane within one batch instead of waiting for the next key (an agent CLI's "Esc to interrupt"
//    must not need a second key). A longer prefix (`ESC [ 2`, `ESC [ 2 0`, `ESC [ 2 0 0`) is no key: it
//    stays held for the next input, so a start marker split across two casts with a batch flush in
//    between is still a paste. Residual: one split right after `ESC` or `ESC [` that waits longer than
//    a batch interval for its second cast is typed as keys (the same bytes, unframed by tmux).
//  - A trailing high surrogate outside a paste is held the same way (and never drained: no key ends on
//    half a character), so an emoji split across two casts is not typed as two replacement characters.
//  - A paste is cut at PASTE_MAX units (never between the halves of a surrogate pair); the rest up to
//    its end is discarded, and the splitter keeps looking for the end, so typing after it is keys.
//  - Input the host DROPPED (over budget, no session to type into) is fed to `discard()`, which keeps
//    the framing and delivers nothing: a paste that any dropped part belonged to is discarded WHOLE.
//    Without it a paste whose end marker was dropped would stay open for good and swallow every key
//    typed after it, and a paste whose start was dropped would have its text typed as KEYS — each
//    newline a command run in the shell. A dropped input that ENDS in a start-marker prefix keeps that
//    prefix, marked dropped: completed by the next input it opens a paste that is discarded whole;
//    not completed, it is dropped (never typed, never drained).
