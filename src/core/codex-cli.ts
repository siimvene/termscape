/**
 * Capability probe for the LOCAL Codex CLI — the codex analogue of `core/claude-cli.ts`, and
 * deliberately a SECOND probe rather than a reuse of claude's.
 *
 * CLAUDE.md states the rule this file exists to obey: a capability gate fed by a version probe
 * belongs to the agent it probes. Claude's `auto` gate is fed by `claude --version`; applying it to
 * codex would downgrade codex sessions on a machine whose *claude* is old or missing, and reading
 * codex's vocabulary off claude's probe would be the same mistake with the arrow reversed.
 *
 * Today it answers exactly one question — which values does this `codex` accept for
 * `--ask-for-approval`? — but it is shaped as a caps bag so the next codex fact lands here instead
 * of growing a third probe.
 *
 * WHY THE VALUES AND NOT A VERSION NUMBER. The vocabulary is not stable across releases: measured
 * on real binaries, 0.146.0–0.148.0 advertise `untrusted, on-request, never` and 0.149.0 onwards
 * advertise `on-request, never`. A version floor would work today and would be wrong the next time
 * OpenAI moves the set, and it cannot answer for a build that is not on npm at all. Reading the
 * CLI's own `--help` asks the binary in front of us what it actually takes — the same choice
 * `codexCliSupportsRemote` and claude's `--session-id` detection already made.
 *
 * Lives in core (not main) so the Server Edition boots it through the same CorePlatform seam: the
 * server's own machine is the one that runs its Codex sessions, so it needs the real answer, not a
 * stub. The remote (SSH) host's codex is a different binary and is NOT covered here — a remote
 * launch falls back to the baseline vocabulary, see `ApprovalCaps` in shared/agents/approval-mode.

/**
 * Pure: `codex --help` output → the `--ask-for-approval` values it advertises, or `null` when the
 * page did not say (absent output, an option we could not find, a shape we do not recognise).
 *
 * `null` is a first-class answer and NOT an empty list: "the CLI accepts nothing" and "we could not
 * read the page" lead to different decisions one layer up, where `null` resolves to the baseline
 * vocabulary and an empty list would forbid every value including the two that have always worked.
 *
 * BOTH of clap's renderings are handled, because both are real. Long `--help` prints a block:
 *
 *     -a, --ask-for-approval <APPROVAL_POLICY>
 *             Configure when the model requires human approval before executing a command
 *
 *             Possible values:
 *             - on-request: The model decides when to ask the user for approval
 *             - never:      Never ask for user approval Execution failures are immediately
 *               returned to the model
 *
 * short `-h` prints it inline and wraps it mid-phrase:
 *
 *     -a, --ask-for-approval <APPROVAL_POLICY>
 *             Configure when the model requires human approval ... [possible
 *             values: on-request, never]
 *
 * — which is why the inline branch joins the slice before matching rather than working line by
 * line. The probe below asks for the long form; the short form is handled so a caller that has
 * `-h` output lying around gets the same answer instead of a silent `null`.
 *
 * Every token is validated against `[a-z][a-z0-9-]*`. These strings are appended to a launch
 * command that is typed into a tmux pane, so the help page is untrusted input at an interpolation
 * site like any other — a token we would not recognise is dropped rather than quoted and hoped
 * for, and if nothing survives the answer is `null`.
