/**
 * The session-scoped project-grant ledger + the `--project` targeting gate (issue #338, spec §3).
 *
 * WHO MAY TARGET WHAT: a control caller may aim an open verb (`open-terminal`/`open-claude`/
 * `open-agent`) at (a) its OWN project, or (b) a project id that `open-project` RETURNED TO THAT
 * SAME CALLER in this app run. Nothing else — arbitrary cross-project targeting is deliberately
 * not v1 (confused-deputy-adjacent; a future version needs the target project's own capability
 * consent via the #213 mechanism, which would be a third disjunct in `gateProjectTarget`, not a
 * redesign).
 *
 * IN MEMORY, IN THE CORE PROCESS, NEVER PERSISTED — the browser-ownership-ledger posture
 * (browser-control-ledger.ts), for the same reason: a grant is a record of consent given to a
 * RUNNING session, not a durable claim. An app restart clears every grant; a caller's node
 * teardown (pty destroy/recycle, wired in index.ts) clears that caller's. Recording happens ONLY
 * in the desktop control-handler wrapper on `result.ok && verified` — the core's identity verdict for
 * that request, never anything off the wire or out of project.json.
 *
 * PURE on purpose: no electron, no fs, no child_process (project-grants.test.ts asserts this
 * structurally). It unit-tests like agent-message-scope.ts and cannot persist anything even by
 * accident.
