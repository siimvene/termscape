// Issue #629 — the invariant: **a test never touches the machine's live nodeterm tmux server.**
//
// This repo is developed from inside nodeterm, so `tmux -L node-terminal` and `-L nodeterm-rmt` are
// not names in a fixture — on a contributor's machine they are the servers holding every terminal
// they have open. A test that binds one shares a process with the user's entire canvas, and the
// failure mode is not a red test: it is every pane printing `[server exited unexpectedly]`.
//
// It is enforced three ways, deliberately, because each covers what the others cannot:
//
//   1. STRUCTURAL — `test/setup/tmux-sandbox.ts` gives the run a private `TMUX_TMPDIR`, which
//      re-points every socket name, the real ones included. This is the only leg that covers a test
//      nobody thought about.
//   2. BEHAVIOURAL — the third test below actually starts a server on the real socket NAME and
//      proves the socket file landed inside the sandbox. Asserting the environment variable would
//      only prove we set a variable; the resolution rule is a property of tmux.
//   3. BY REVIEW — the scan at the bottom lists the files that hand a real socket name to a real
//      tmux binary. It cannot stop a new one being written; it makes writing one a decision
//      somebody signs for, the way `fs-atomic.guard.test.ts` does for a bare rename.
//
// The scan is the weakest of the three ON PURPOSE. A test can still escape the sandbox by handing a
// real tmux an `env` object it built from scratch (with no `TMUX_TMPDIR` in it), and no regex sees
// that reliably; the allowlist is what keeps such a file rare and reviewed.
