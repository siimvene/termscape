  // this never runs again; the legacy field lives on only as a downgrade mirror (the renderer
  // write path keeps it in sync so an older build still finds the user's chord).
  // A shortcut EQUAL to the default seeds nothing: the override would only restate what the
  // registry already says, and would then pin that chord against any future default change.
  // **The seeded value survives the read path.** `speech.dictation` has its OWN conflict bucket
  // (`conflictBucket` in shared/keybindings.ts), so it can never be a participant in a
  // cross-command collision, and the READ path's sanitizer (`sanitizeKeybindingOverrides`) has
  // nothing to strip — neither the seed nor the user's own override on the same chord. (It used
  // not to: both were deleted on load, and dictation silently fell back to the registry default.)

  // claims it first in plain app focus, and the other command still gets it everywhere dictation
  // does not listen — terminal focus, say. That is exactly the pre-migration behavior of a legacy
