/**
 * The `unproven-target-owner` refusal told its caller to do something that does not work, and
 * nothing in a 11k-test suite noticed — because no test read the sentence.
 *
 * It said: "Re-open the target node so its owner is recorded, then try again." Ownership is
 * recorded ONLY on a genuine fresh spawn (`shouldRecordOwnership`, `fresh === true`), and after an
 * app restart the tmux server has survived, so re-opening ATTACHES to the running session and
 * records nothing. A caller that obeyed got the identical refusal, forever.
 *
 * These assertions pin the sentence against the MECHANISM rather than against itself: the prose
 * claims attaching cannot prove ownership, and the test asks `shouldRecordOwnership` whether that
 * is true. That is the shape that would have caught the original — see the repo's rule about
 * claims written ahead of the mechanism.
