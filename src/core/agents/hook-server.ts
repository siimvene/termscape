 *
 * Consulted in the `/control/` route BEFORE `identityGate`'s decision is, so no future change to

    // answer: the agent id is a fact about a tmux session that OUTLIVES this process, and the
    // launcher POSTing here runs inside that pane with the `NODETERM_AGENT_ID` `buildPtyEnv` put
    // there. Nothing on the server side is as durable — an in-memory map from `buildPtyEnv` is
    // empty for every node whose pane predates this app run, which is the norm after a restart and
    // permanent for a node in a project the user has not opened.
    //
    // It is not a capability claim. A caller only reaches this line by presenting a token this
    // instance minted FOR THIS NODE (`nodeTokenVerified` above, strict), so it is the node; the
    // record it shapes is re-exported into that same node's own tool shells and nowhere else; and
    // the env var it sets is not what authorizes anything (see `identityGate` — the per-node token
    // is). Lying about it buys the liar the label they already had.
    //
    // THE GRANT IS NOT ECHOED. It is derived here by `canControlCanvas` — the same predicate, in
    // the same process, that `buildPtyEnv` used to gate the pane — so there is exactly ONE decider
    // and a forged agent id cannot manufacture a grant the table would refuse. An unparseable or
