// The ONE definition of grok's config + session path algebra: `src/main`, `src/core`, `src/server`
// and the SSH installer all import it from here. Drift between two copies of a path rule is exactly
// what made the remote hook installer subscribe gemini to claude's event names for months —
// `core/usage/grok-usage.ts`'s `grokHome()` therefore delegates to `grokHomeDir()` rather than
// re-deriving `$GROK_HOME`.
//
// It lives in `src/core`, NOT `src/shared/agents`, even though its callers span three process
// contexts: it reads `os.homedir()` and measures with `Buffer` (per call — the point is that both
// are node-only APIs, not when they run), and `src/shared` is renderer territory — the renderer imports `shared/agents/*`, and `tsconfig.web.json` carries node
// types, so a renderer import of this file would typecheck cleanly and fail only at bundle or run
// time. `src/core` is node-side by construction (no electron, no renderer), which is exactly this
// file's contract. Should a renderer surface ever need one of these helpers, split the genuinely
// pure half out (the encoding/validation functions) instead of moving the file back.
//
// Layout per grok's shipped 1.0.0 docs (`~/.grok/docs/user-guide/17-sessions.md:18,27`) — NOT observed:
// the branch never had a logged-in session, so no `$GROK_HOME/sessions/` tree ever existed here to
// look at. Every path rule below is therefore a claim about that document:
//   $GROK_HOME/hooks/*.json                     — hook files, all merged; GROK_HOME defaults to ~/.grok
//   $GROK_HOME/sessions/<encoded cwd>/<id>/     — one directory per session, grouped by cwd
//     summary.json  updates.jsonl  chat_history.jsonl  signals.json  plan.json  subagents/

/** grok's config directory: `$GROK_HOME`, else `~/.grok`. Hooks AND sessions live under it.
 *
 *  KNOWN TRAP — the env this reads is the APP's, not the user's shell. A desktop app launched from
 *  Finder/Dock/a `.desktop` entry inherits the launcher's environment, which never sourced
 *  `.zshrc`/`.bashrc`; this repo already knows the class, which is why `findTmux()` resolves an
 *  absolute path "because GUI apps don't inherit the shell PATH". So for a user whose only
 *  `export GROK_HOME=…` lives in a shell rc file, the two sides disagree: nodeterm writes the hook
 *  file (and looks for sessions) under `~/.grok`, while the grok CLI — started by the shell inside a
 *  tmux pane, which DID source that rc — reads the exported path. Nothing errors. The hook file is
 *  written successfully, grok never loads it, and the consequence is total and silent: no RUNNING /
 *  NEEDS YOU badge, no unread dot, no completion notification, no session name, ever, with no
 *  diagnostic anywhere.
 *
 *  The REMOTE path is BETTER, not immune, and the difference is worth being precise about: it at least
 *  ASKS the host (`RemoteHooks.installGrokRemote` runs `printf %s "${GROK_HOME:-}"`) and validates the
 *  answer (`isSafeRemoteGrokHome`) before falling back to `$HOME/.grok` deliberately. But that probe
 *  goes over a **plain ssh exec channel**, not a login shell, so it shares this exact blind spot: a
 *  host that exports `GROK_HOME` only from `.bashrc` reports empty and silently gets `~/.grok`. That is
 *  checklist item 26, which exists BECAUSE the remote side has the problem too.
 *
 *  Deliberately NOT fixed here: resolving it means probing the user's login shell for `GROK_HOME`
 *  (a spawn, a cache, and a fail-open policy), which is its own change with its own failure modes —
 *  not a comment. It is item 31 in docs/grok-agent.md's device checklist ("is `GROK_HOME` set in your
 *  shell?") because a device run is what tells us whether anyone actually sets it. */
