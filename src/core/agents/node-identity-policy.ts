/**
 * What a per-node token BUYS, per route: the policy that turns the three-way verdict from
 * `verifyNodeToken` into allow / allow-with-warning / refuse.
 *
 * The whole identity series up to here is measurement — it can say `verified`, `legacy`, `forged`
 * and it labels events with the answer, but nothing has ever DEPENDED on it. This file is where it
 * starts to. That is the dangerous half, because the population it governs is already running:
 * tmux sessions outlive the app, so on the day this ships there are live agent sessions holding a
 * launcher, a skill shim and an environment from before the token existed. Enforce on day one and
 * their next `manage-nodeterm-canvas` call stops working with no way for them to know why.
 *
 * So enforcement arrives in two moves, and both are here rather than scattered through the routes:
 *
 *  1. TRUST ON FIRST PROOF. A node that has never presented a token this instance minted keeps the
 *     legacy path. A node that HAS is latched: an unverified request naming it afterwards is
 *     refused, because that session demonstrably CAN authenticate and one that suddenly cannot is
 *     either a different process wearing its node id or a forgery this instance cannot name. The
 *     latch costs the legacy population nothing — they never prove anything, so they never latch.
 *
 *  2. A DATED WINDOW. Until `NODE_IDENTITY_STRICT_AFTER` an unverified MUTATION still executes and
 *     the reply carries `IDENTITY_RESTART_NOTE`, which names the fix and the date. After it, the
 *     same situation is a refusal. The date is in the source, not in a comment saying "later":
 *     a tightening with no date is a tightening that never happens.

/**
 * How far past the cutoff the LOCAL CLOCK may read before the cutoff stops being believed at all.
 *
 * The cutoff is compared against `Date.now()`, and a machine clock is not evidence. A VM restored
 * from a snapshot, a board whose RTC came up wrong, or a clock somebody set forward on purpose can
 * put a perfectly ordinary install years into the future — and it then enters strict mode on day
 * one, with no warning window, refusing every unverified mutation with a sentence naming a date
 * that has "already passed". The symptom reads as "the token is broken", so nobody looks at the
 * clock, and the escape hatch is the last place they think to go.
 *
 * There is no way to tell that case apart from an install genuinely still running years after the
 * cutoff: an old binary can run forever, so `now` far ahead of anything in this source proves
 * nothing on its own. Since the two are indistinguishable, the tie is broken by which mistake is
 * worse — and the whole series fails OPEN by design, so the answer is to keep the window open.
 *
 * That costs almost nothing, and it is worth being exact about WHY, because the obvious reason is
 * false. **Neither the cutoff nor the latch is a boundary against an attacker.** The latch protects
 * against a MISTAKE — a session that silently stopped presenting its token. It cannot protect
 * against an adversary, because an adversary picks the `kid`: a made-up `kid` is a FOREIGN kid,
 * which invariant 3 requires to be `legacy` and never latched (or cross-instance failover dies), so
 * an invented token walks past the latch AND the cutoff into `/control/list` and every
 * `/context-link/*` read. Measured against the real server and pinned in
 * `hook-identity-enforcement.test.ts` ("an invented kid is admitted"); see docs/node-identity.md.
 *
 * So the clamp is cheap for a smaller and more honest reason: what it relaxes is only the
 * population that has NEVER proven anything, i.e. exactly the pre-token sessions the warning window
 * exists for, and fail-open is that population's designed state. It relaxes the DATE and nothing
 * else — `forged` and the latch are untouched by it.
 *
 * Two years, because that is comfortably longer than the upgrade population survives (tmux sessions
 * and un-updated installs do not last it out) and comfortably shorter than the clock skews that
 * actually occur, which are measured in decades (an RTC default year, an epoch reset, a licence
 * clock set forward).
 *
 * The same reasoning as `license.ts`'s rollback anchor, pointed the other way: there, the clock
 * direction the USER benefits from (setting it back to revive an expired token) is the one that is
 * refused, via `Math.max(Date.now(), lastSeen)`. Here the direction a user benefits from is setting
 * the clock BACK to dodge the cutoff — and that buys them nothing worth defending, because
 * `hookIdentityStrict: false` grants exactly the same thing with one click. So there is no security
 * to trade away by disbelieving a clock that reads absurdly far forward; there is only a silent
 * day-one lockout to remove.

 * one is `open-browser`, which is deliberately NOT in here (see below). So measured over the real
 * verb list, this set changes nothing for anybody: no request that succeeds today starts failing,
 * and `hookIdentityStrict: false` releases exactly what it released before. What it does is make
 * the ordering correct BEFORE the verb exists, so the verb cannot arrive through the hole. The
 * hole was real — the `override === false` branch below returns `allow-with-warning` for every
 * non-tolerant verb — and a route that acts as the user on the internet must not be the thing that
 * discovers it.
 *
 * The verb it is for is a route through which an agent acts as the user on the internet, inside a
 * session jar that may hold real logins, and it is NEW — so unlike every verb the two-move rollout
 * was built for, there is no legacy population to strand and nothing to fail open FOR. Same posture
 * `/codex-thread/{start,bind}` already holds, for the same reason.
 *
 * **Why `open-browser` is NOT in here, deliberately.** OPENING a node is not DRIVING one. The
 * threat this bucket answers is an agent acting *inside* a page the user is logged into — reading
 * cookies, typing, evaluating script; `open-browser` only creates the surface and navigates it to
 * a URL the caller supplied, which is the same class of act as `show-web`. And it is a SHIPPED
 * verb with a live legacy population: adding it would mean an agent session that has not picked up
 * a token (a pre-token tmux session, or an SSH host whose project has not reconnected) loses the
 * ability to open a browser node with no way back — the hatch cannot rescue it, because the whole
 * point of this bucket is that the hatch does not reach it. That is precisely the stranding the
 * dated window exists to prevent, paid to defend a surface that holds nothing yet. The residual is
 * named rather than hidden: an unverified caller can open a node onto a logged-in page, and the
 * page's TITLE then appears in `list`. That leak belongs to `list`'s tolerance, is unchanged by
 * this file, and is the pre-existing trade documented on TOLERANT_CONTROL_VERBS.
 *
 * So: this doc comment claims a gate on DRIVING a browser, never on opening one. When the real
 * verb lands it joins this set in the PR that creates it, and that PR — not this one — is where a
 * user-visible behaviour change begins.
 *
 * Checked BEFORE the `override === false` branch, deliberately. That branch returns
 * `allow-with-warning` for any non-tolerant verb, so `settings.hookIdentityStrict: false` — the
 * switch docs/node-identity.md tells a stranded user to reach for — would otherwise hand browser
 * control to any holder of the app-wide bearer, permanently. The escape hatch exists to rescue a
 * session that cannot present an identity; it must not double as a grant of the one capability
 * where identity is the entire admission control.
 *
 * WHAT IT BUYS, precisely: an invented `kid` is a FOREIGN kid, which invariant 3 requires to be
