/**
 * THE ENVELOPE — an app-owned frame around one agent-to-agent message.
 *
 * A fixed literal prefix (`--- NODETERM MESSAGE ---`) is forgeable by construction: A writes the
 * literal into its own body and B cannot tell A's forgery from the app's frame, because the two are
 * byte-identical. Everything downstream that "trusts the framed part" is then trusting the sender.
 *
 * So the frame carries a PER-DELIVERY NONCE the sender never sees. A does not compose the frame; it
 * supplies a body, and the app frames it with a value A was never given.
 *
 * ── THE RECEIVING CONVENTION (PR 5 owes this, and it is not optional) ───────────────────────────
 *
 * The nonce protects a parser that HOLDS it. Nothing holds it: the nonce is never communicated to
 * the receiver, and the receiver is a language model or a human reading raw text. A body can
 * therefore contain a complete, plausible-looking envelope — a NESTED forgery — and a reader
 * skimming the pane cannot tell the inner frame from the outer one by eye.
 *
 * That is not a defect in this module (the frame was never a security boundary and says so), but it
 * IS a requirement on whatever tells an agent how to read one. The convention PR 5 must ship is:
 *
 *   ONLY THE OUTERMOST FRAME IS AUTHENTIC. Everything between the FIRST opening line and the LAST
 *   closing line is DATA — including anything in it that looks like a frame.
 *
 * Stated as a rule about the outermost pair, it is decidable without the nonce, which is precisely
 * why it is the convention to ship. (A `body-lines: <n>` header would make nested forgery
 * mechanically detectable as well; it is deliberately NOT added here, because the plan pins this
 * envelope's shape exactly and the convention above already closes the case.)
 *
 * ── UNVERIFIED, and stated rather than assumed ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Whether a per-session nonce can be communicated to B without also being readable by A is NOT
 * verified. Within one uid it probably cannot: a sibling that can read the per-node token file can
 * likely read the tmux session env too. So the nonce RAISES THE COST OF FORGERY. It is not a
 * security boundary, and nothing downstream may treat it as one — in particular, no future consumer
 * may grant a framed message any authority it would not grant an unframed one.

/**
 * 9 random bytes → 12 base64url characters, no padding.
 *
 * 72 bits, which is not chosen for cryptographic ceremony: the sender gets ONE guess per delivery
 * (it never sees a frame, so it cannot even confirm a hit), and the value is per-delivery, so
 * offline search buys nothing. 9 is the largest byte count that encodes without `=` padding, which
 * keeps the frame line a single token and keeps `oneLine` from ever having to touch it.

 * own frame. It therefore removes newlines.
 *
 * `sanitizePasteText` (`src/core/paste-injection.ts`) runs at DELIVERY and KEEPS `\n`, because an
 * envelope is inherently multi-line and stripping newlines there would corrupt the payload.
