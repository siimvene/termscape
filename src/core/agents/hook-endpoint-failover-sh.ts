/**
 * ENDPOINT FAILOVER, THE SH HALF — one candidate walk, every generated client.
 *
 * A session is pinned for life to the endpoint PATH it was handed at tmux creation
 * (`buildPtyEnv` / `remoteHookEnvArgs`): tmux ignores `-e` on an existing session, and the env of
 * a live shell cannot be rewritten from outside. So every generated sh client ultimately trusts
 * one file on disk, and that file can go stale in ways the session cannot see:
 *
 *  - the app quit or crashed and the file still advertises its old random port (issue #445 — a
 *    `nodeterm.sh open-agent` from a live worktree session died with "endpoint unreachable"
 *    while the reviewer launch it carried was silently dropped);
 *  - the path carries a project id that a cross-lineage adoption retired, so the file is never
 *    rewritten again while the session keeps posting into it (the managed script's stale-project
 *    case);
 *  - the session was spawned before any endpoint file existed at all (phone spawn on a bare
 *    host).
 *
 * The managed hook script grew this walk first (see the "Fallback ordering and bound" block in
 * `hooks/managed-script.ts` for the measured reasoning behind the ordering and the bound); the
 * canvas-control and context-link shims did not, so the SAME stale file that a hook event healed
 * itself around stopped every canvas-control verb cold — the exact asymmetry issue #384 already
 * documented for the token read, one layer up. The helpers live here now, like
 * `node-token-sh.ts`, because a rule with three copies is a rule where one copy is wrong
 * (this repo's own drift lesson, three times over).
 *
 * What the fragment defines:
 *  - `nt_fallback_max` — how many candidates may be tried AFTER the primary failed;
 *  - `nt_candidates <tried>` — the candidate endpoint files, one per line, most-likely-alive
 *    first (locals before reverse tunnels — they fail independently; tunnels share one fate);
 *  - `nt_adopt <file>` — source one candidate, clearing SOCK/PORT/TOKEN_DIR first so a dead
 *    transport or a foreign token dir never leaks from one candidate into the next.
 *
 * Callers own the retry loop itself (the managed script's `nt_send_request`, each shim's walk):
 * the POST shape differs per client, the walk does not. After `nt_adopt`, re-read the token with
 * `nt_read_node_token "$candidate"` (node-token-sh.ts) — the capability must come from the dir
 * the adopted endpoint advertises, never from the one being walked away from.
 *
 * Safety is the same argument as the token resolver's: sending one node's request over another
 * instance's endpoint is correct where it can succeed at all — the node id in the body is what
 * identifies the session, a foreign instance that does not know it refuses with its ordinary
 * answer, and a foreign token dir yields a foreign kid = `legacy`, bit-for-bit what presenting
 * nothing already gave.
 */
/**
 * The line both shims append under their generic transport-failure sentence when a transport WAS
 * advertised and nothing — primary or fallback — answered. It names the actual state (a stale
 * endpoint, not a broken canvas link) and the one action that works, so an agent reading it stops
 * relinking/restarting things that were never the problem. Shared for the same reason as the walk:
 * two copies of one diagnosis drift into two diagnoses.
