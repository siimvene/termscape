 * Node ids this run has SEEN on a canvas. The orphan sweep's only source of authority.
 *
 * A token file outlives its node whenever the node leaves the canvas by any path that does not go
 * through `ptyManager.destroy(intent:'delete')` — a project removed, a canvas edited elsewhere, a
 * `project.json` rewritten by hand — so `node-tokens/` grows one 0600 file per dead id, forever.
 *
 * The tempting fix, "delete every file whose id is not in `canvasNodeIds()`", is WRONG here and it
 * is worth writing down why: `workspaceStore.persistedCanvases()` is explicitly a view of what has
 * been READ this run ("a project whose file has never been read this run is simply absent"). Its
 * absence from that list is not evidence that a node is gone — and sweeping a live node's token
 * un-proves it and drops it to `legacy`, which after the cutoff is a node that cannot drive the
 * canvas at all.
 *
 * So the sweep only ever removes an id it has positively OBSERVED on a canvas earlier this run and
 * that has since disappeared. Positive evidence in, positive evidence out. `initNodeTokens` starts
 * it empty, so the BOOT pass — the one most likely to run against a half-loaded index — sweeps
 * nothing and only records. What this cannot reclaim is a file orphaned by a PREVIOUS run; that
 * needs an authoritative enumeration of every canvas, which this shell does not have.

 * The token FILENAME has to stay the bare node id: the client is `sh` + `curl`, it holds only
 * `$NODETERM_NODE_ID`, and it cannot hash. That makes the filesystem's own name-equality part of
 * this scheme's trust model — and on APFS (the primary desktop target) `Term-1` and `term-1` are
 * ONE inode while `isSafeNodeId` calls them two different nodes.
 *
 * A hostile `project.json` (they travel in shared/cloned repos) can therefore put both ids on one
 * canvas and choose, by array order, whose token lands in the shared file last. The loser reads the
 * winner's token and POSTs as the winner ⇒ `verified` as a node it does not own. Reverse the order
 * and the victim reads a token minted for the ATTACKER's id ⇒ its own posts verdict `forged` ⇒ 403
 * on /hook/*, and the managed script's `curl -sS` has no `--fail`, so a 403 exits 0, no failover
 * fires, and the node goes silently dark for the life of the session.
 *
 * So: detect the collision at MATERIALISATION and write NONE of the colliding set — plus sweep any
 * file an earlier (pre-collision) pass already wrote for them, because leaving that one in place is
 * exactly the attack. Refusing means those nodes fall back to `legacy`, which is the designed
 * fail-open state, not an outage. Validating at node-CREATION time cannot work: the file arrives
 * pre-written from the repo, no creation path is involved.
