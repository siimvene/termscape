/**
 * The messaging verbs admit ONLY a `verified` caller — proven on the wire, against the real
 * hook server, on both sides of every escape hatch.
 *
 * The load-bearing claim: `settings.hookIdentityStrict: false` releases the latch and the dated
 * cutoff (node-identity-policy.ts, the `override === false` branch), and the foreign-kid escape
 * walks past both (an invented kid is FOREIGN, therefore `legacy`, therefore inside the branch the
 * hatch releases). Neither may release `send`/`reply`. That is why `requiresVerified` is a separate
 * check in hook-server.ts and NOT a controlPolicy row — and why this suite drives the HTTP route
 * rather than the policy table: a policy-table test cannot see the route consulting the policy
 * first.
