/**
 * `deliverAgentMessage` — ONE primitive: lock, pre-flight, paste-framed write, post-write re-verify,
 * receipt.
 *
 * EVERY side effect is an injected dep. That is not testing ceremony: it is what lets the
 * SEQUENCING be tested without a pty (this file's sibling unit test) while the PANE BEHAVIOUR is
 * tested against a real tmux pane and a real reader (`agent-message.realtty.test.ts`). A structural
 * test can only catch the tricks it was taught, and this repo has twice shipped a defect that a
 * hand-rolled parser passed and a real reader caught.
 *
 * ── THE RESIDUAL RISK THAT NO GATE CLOSES (recorded here, not only in the design) ────────────────
 *
 * hook-idle ≠ nobody typing. A human's half-composed draft in a genuinely idle agent's composer
 * gets the message appended and the Enter submits both. That is the literal 2026-07-16 objection, it
 * is undetectable from hooks, and G4 plus the trace are what make it diagnosable rather than
 * invisible.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT IN v1: CATCH-UP AFTER RESTART ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * PR 7's deliver-on-idle queue is IN-MEMORY (`delivery-queue.ts`), and its existence must not imply
 * a persisted one. Catch-up after an app restart is NOT built. A persisted queue would need the same
 * TTL AND a "stale — the sender may have moved on" marker, because `--resume` can land the message
 * in a conversation that no longer expects it — and whether an agent given a stale-marked message
 * behaves better than one given none is a PROMPT question, unverified, to be measured before that
 * queue is built.
 */

/** How long the receipt waits for the target's own next turn.
 *
 * 8 s, and deliberately nowhere near the transport ceiling. `CONTROL_CEILING_MS` is 130 s and the
 * desktop's own control await is 120 s, but that headroom exists so a HUMAN CONFIRMATION DIALOG can
 * stay open. Borrowing it for an automated wait makes a stuck receipt look like a stuck dialog,
 * which is the one thing the person debugging this must be able to tell apart. herdr uses ~5 s; 8
 * gives a slow codex start room without approaching either bound.
 *
 * The receipt is also what makes deliver-on-idle safe (PR 7): a queued message that is never
 * consumed surfaces as an error instead of vanishing.

/**
 * Is the pane we just wrote into still the pane we checked — and is the same agent PROCESS still in
 * it?
 *
 * Four things must all hold, and each closes a different way the answer can be yes-but-wrong:
 *
 *  1. **`paneId`** (`#{pane_id}`). tmux guarantees it unique for the life of the server and never
 *     reuses it. A tty number, by contrast, is recycled aggressively, so `/dev/pts/9` after is not
 *     evidence of `/dev/pts/9` before.
 *  2. **`tty`** — kept as the cheap corroboration, and the only one an older read carries.
 *  3. **`panePid`** — the pane's ROOT process. Necessary but nowhere near sufficient: it is the
 *     login shell, which OUTLIVES the agent it launched. Isolated by its own test, because a test
 *     that changes the tty and the pane pid together proves neither.
 *  4. **The agent's OWN pid** (`agentPidIn`). This is the one that closes the exploit:
 *
 *         pane root = bash(1000), claude(2000) in the foreground group  → we write
 *         claude exits before reading; bash reads the pasted lines and EXECUTES them
 *         a wrapper (`while :; do claude; done`) starts claude(2100)
 *         post-probe: same pane id, same tty, same pane pid, an agent in the group
 *
 *     On names alone that is "unchanged", and the body that just ran as shell commands would be
 *     reported `delivered`. The pid moved; comparing it is what makes the window OBSERVABLE. It
 *     still cannot un-send the bytes — nothing can — but the sender is told and the trace records
 *     it, which is the whole and only job of a post-write check.
 *
 * NOT argv equality: an agent's foreground group grows a member every time it runs a tool, so argv
 * equality would cry "replaced" on every busy pane and turn a real signal into noise nobody reads.
 *
 * Every UNKNOWN is a "no". A lapsed probe, a read with no `paneId`, a read with no `pids` — none of
 * them can confirm anything, and the fail direction here is to TELL the sender:
 * `deliveredToReplacedTarget` with `nowPane: 'unknown'`, never `delivered`.

 * `PANE_PROBE_TIMEOUT_MS` (2 s) and, on an SSH project, a real round-trip over the ControlMaster. A

 * delivery reports `stalled` while the target demonstrably advanced. `RETRYABLE.stalled` is false,
 * but a language model reading "stalled, waited 8000ms" retries anyway — and the retry is a SECOND
 * delivery of a message that already landed.
 *
 * So the subscription opens before the bytes go out and holds anything that arrives. The deadline
 * still starts at `wait()`, i.e. after the write and the probe: the 8 s is a budget for the
 * target's response, not for our own round-trips, and letting a slow probe eat a quarter of it
 * would make the timeout mean something different on SSH than on local.
