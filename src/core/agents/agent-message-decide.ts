   *
   * `agent` proves the agent is IN the pane's foreground process group. It does NOT prove the agent

   * somewhere else. The delivery RECEIPT (Task 3.4) is what makes that case observable rather than
   * silent — it is the only thing in this feature that can tell "B read it" from "the bytes are
   * sitting in a buffer" — and it is why a `stalled` outcome exists at all.
   *
   * Two false negatives are expected here and are NOT papered over: an agent script path containing
   * a SPACE (the argv split cannot tell it from two tokens) and a differently-named SYMLINK to the
   * agent binary (argv carries the name it was invoked as, not the target). Both answer `not-agent`
   * ⇒ `targetNotAgentPane`, a refusal, which is the safe direction. Do not "fix" either by matching
   * a substring of the command line: `vim /etc/claude.conf` would then be a claude pane.

 *    file may well be sitting right there. Checked FIRST because it is the OUTER CAUSE: fixing it
 *    is what makes the other two checks mean anything. The action differs by surface — a local
 *    host's script is rewritten unconditionally at every boot (`install-helper.ts`), a remote
 *    host's only inside `RemoteHooks.setup()` on CONNECT, so an already-connected project needs a
 *    reconnect. NOT retryable: no number of retries reinstalls a script.
 * 2. NO TOKEN FILE. The node cannot prove itself at all. NOT retryable — it needs a human.
 * 3. TOKEN FILE PRESENT, CURRENT SCRIPT, no verified event yet. It simply has not posted since the
 *    file appeared. Retryable — wait for its next turn.
 *
 * The trap #1 closes: before the script stamped itself (`X-Nodeterm-Hook-Client`), an old script
 * POSTing `version=2` with no token header was byte-identical on the wire to a current script whose
 * token file was merely missing. A token-file check alone would answer "retry after its next turn"
 * for the old-script case — forever, because the script cannot read the file. A permanently wrong
 * retry is worse than a refusal.
 *
 * Measured 2026-08-15: a PHONE-SPAWNED session lands in NONE of these on a host running nodeterm.
 * It sources the 0600 endpoint file it was handed, reads `$NODETERM_NODE_TOKEN_DIR/$NODETERM_NODE_ID`
 * and presents it, and verifies. rev. 3 of the design claimed the opposite; it was wrong, and the
 * reason it is wrong is the PERSIST-TIME token sweep (`refreshNodeTokens` on `onPersist`), NOT
 * `ptyManager.create` — which a phone-spawned session never touches.
