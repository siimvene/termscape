// Antigravity CLI (`agy`) status-hook installer — registered in hooks/index.ts (runs at every launch).
//
// WHERE. `agy` reads its global hooks from `~/.gemini/config/hooks.json` (its bundled
// `json_configs.md`/`hooks.md`: "placed in your customization root directory (e.g., `.agents/` in
// your project, or `~/.gemini/config/` globally)"). The file is keyed by BUNDLE: each top-level key
// is one named bundle whose value maps event names to handlers, and bundles are merged and run in
// sequence. We own exactly one bundle, `nodeterm-status`, and nothing else in the file:
//   - every other top-level key survives untouched (another tool's bundle, the user's own);
//   - our bundle is REWRITTEN whole on every install (it is ours; there is nothing of the user's
//     inside it), which is also what collapses a duplicated install back to one entry (#558);
//   - a handler carrying OUR script tail found in any OTHER bundle is swept out, matched through
//     `normalizeHookCommand` on both sides (the #558 lesson: Windows separators);
//   - `~/.gemini/settings.json` and `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md` are never touched here — they belong to
//     the Gemini CLI, and `agy` does not read hooks from settings.json (measured).
//
// Two shapes, per `hooks.md` "Supported Event Types": the tool events are GROUPED
// (`[{matcher, hooks: [handler]}]`) and the lifecycle events are a FLAT handler list.
//
// A hooks.json we cannot parse (or whose top level is not an object) is LEFT ALONE and the install
// is skipped with a warning — the codex installer's precedent. Overwriting would destroy whatever
// the user had in it, and it is their file, not ours.
//
// SAFETY. Subscribing to `PreToolUse` puts this hook in front of every tool call of every `agy` on
// the machine. What keeps that gate open is the stdout contract (antigravity-decision.ts), answered
// by the script, by the POSIX command's own fallback when the script is missing, by the Windows
// wrapper when there is no shell, and — when the wrapper itself is missing — by the Windows
// command's `if exist` guard, which falls silent (see buildAntigravityWindowsCommand). `timeout: 5`
// bounds a hung shell (agy's default is 30 s; our curl is capped at 1.5 s and the POST is
// backgrounded).
