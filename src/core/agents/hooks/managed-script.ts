// Generates the managed hook script installed into an agent's own config.
// It sources the endpoint file for the LIVE port/token (restart handoff), no-ops
// outside nodeterm-spawned sessions (gating via NODETERM_NODE_ID), and posts the
// raw hook payload to the loopback server. Fails open at every step.
//
// Endpoint failover: a session's env points at ONE
// endpoint file ($NODETERM_HOOK_ENDPOINT). A Mac-spawned remote session points at the
// reverse-tunnel endpoint the Mac's RemoteHooks wrote; when the Mac is offline that pipe
// is dead and the POST fails silently, so the session goes dark — even when the SAME host
// runs an always-on headless Server Edition whose endpoint file is alive right next to it.
// So the request POST captures curl's exit status and, on failure, walks the OTHER known endpoint
// files (the SSH reverse-tunnel endpoints `~/.nodeterm/hook-endpoint-*.env` + the server-edition
// dataDir + the desktop userData dirs), sourcing each one's sock/port/token, until one POST
// succeeds. The happy path (primary alive) is unchanged — curl succeeds, no candidate scan, no
// re-POST. A host with no candidate files behaves exactly as before (nothing posts).
//
// FALLBACK ORDERING AND BOUND — both were wrong, and the failure was total.
// v1 picked ONE candidate, the freshest by mtime, and retried exactly once. Measured on a live
// host with the Mac closed and 8 agents running:
//     hook-endpoint-project-mrkigsjp-4.env  13:25  the primary — excluded as already tried
//     hook-endpoint-project-msq9marh-4.env  12:52  another project's tunnel to the SAME Mac, dead
//     .nodeterm-server/hook-endpoint.env    00:26  the host's own Server Edition — ALIVE
// The single retry landed on the dead sibling and gave up; the live local endpoint was never
// tried, and that host's mirror held 0 nodes and 0 events while 8 sessions worked. Two fixes:
//   1. ORDER BY FAILURE DOMAIN, NOT BY MTIME. Every `hook-endpoint-*.env` tunnel on a host
//      terminates at the SAME desktop, so they share one fate — mtime ranks a dead sibling above a
//      listening local server, and the more projects a host has, the deeper the live endpoint is
//      buried. A LOCAL endpoint (the host's own Server Edition, then a desktop installed on this
//      host) is written by a process running HERE and fails independently, so locals go first;
//      tunnels follow, freshest-first among themselves (the live project's endpoint is rewritten
//      and VERIFIED on every connect, so mtime is a good tie-break WITHIN that group). The cost of
//      being wrong is asymmetric: preferring a local when a sibling tunnel was in fact alive still
//      delivers the event (the local instance pushes it) and only loses the desktop's own badge;
//      preferring tunnels when they are all dead loses the event entirely.
//   2. TRY SEVERAL, BUT BOUND IT (`nt_fallback_max`, 3). One retry cannot get past even a single
//      stale sibling. The bound is what keeps the cure from being its own outage: a dead
//      reverse-tunnel socket is not cheap to fail — sshd ACCEPTS the connection and then never
//      answers, so each attempt can burn the full `--max-time 1.5`. 3 is chosen against the
//      candidate list, not picked round: at most 3 local slots exist and the two desktop userData
//      paths are per-OS (mutually exclusive), so a real host has at most 2 locals — 3 attempts
//      therefore always reaches a live local endpoint AND still leaves at least one tunnel slot,
//      while capping the added latency at ~4.5s on a path that has already failed.
// A single-desktop host — one project, one tunnel, no Server Edition — is untouched: the only
// candidate is the tried one, the list comes back empty, and nothing else runs.
//
// Stale-project self-heal (the glob candidate): a remote session's `NODETERM_HOOK_ENDPOINT` is
// baked into its tmux session at CREATION (`new-session -A -e …`, which tmux ignores when the
// session already exists), and the path carries the PROJECT id:
// `~/.nodeterm/hook-endpoint-<projectId>.env`. Node ids (= tmux session names) deliberately
// survive a project-id change — a re-added folder, a cross-lineage `.nodeterm/project.json`
// adoption — but the endpoint file of the OLD project id is then never rewritten again, so those
// long-lived sessions post into a file pointing at a dead tunnel forever while freshly created
// nodes work. Without the glob the candidate list held only host-LOCAL nodeterm installs, so a
// pure SSH host (no nodeterm of its own) had no self-heal at all: permanent "active but idle".
// The glob makes the live project's endpoint — rewritten and VERIFIED on every connect, hence the
// freshest — a valid fallback. Sending one project's node over another project's socket is
// correct: both tunnels terminate at the SAME hook server, and the node id in the body is what
// identifies the session.
//
// Empty-endpoint self-heal: a session spawned when NO endpoint file existed yet (a phone injects
// NODETERM_NODE_ID + NODETERM_HOOK_ENDPOINT="$NT_EP" where $NT_EP resolved empty on a bare host)
// carries a node id but no token. The gate below keys on the NODE ID, not the token, so such a
// session still reaches nt_send_request — whose failover sources a live sibling endpoint (a Server
// Edition installed later, right next to it) and posts under it. Gating on the token instead would
// exit before that failover ran, leaving the session dark until it was recreated.
//
// Deterministic hook-reply approvals (docs/hook-reply-approvals.md): when
// NODETERM_PERM_WAIT_SECS is set (> 0) in the session env AND the incoming hook is a
// PermissionRequest, the script generates a pendingId, drops the request JSON under
// ~/.nodeterm/pending/, tags the POST body with nodeterm_pending_id (so the mirror/inbox
// learns it), then polls for ~/.nodeterm/pending/<pendingId>.answer for up to that many
// seconds. An answer ('allow' | 'deny') is echoed back as the hook's decision JSON; a
// timeout prints nothing and Claude falls through to its normal interactive prompt. On a valid
// answer it ALSO fires a second, backgrounded "answered" POST (nodeterm_answered=<decision>) so the
// NEEDS YOU badge flips to working immediately rather than lingering until the agent's next hook. The
// whole branch is a NO-OP when the env var is absent (a user's own terminals, older
// nodeterm, non-claude agents), so behavior is bit-for-bit legacy there.

 * Bumped by hand whenever this script's CONTRACT with the server changes. Not a git sha and not a

 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. Before it, an old script and a current script whose token file happened to
 * be missing were byte-identical on the wire: both POST `version=2` (that field is sourced from the
 * ENDPOINT FILE, so it reports the server's protocol version, never the client's) and neither sends
 * an X-Nodeterm-Node-Token header. The server therefore could not distinguish "this session cannot
 * read a token" from "there is no token to read" — and those need OPPOSITE advice. Messaging's gate
 * 2 would have told an SSH-only host's session to retry after its next turn, forever.
 *
 * Two stale windows this makes visible, and they are ONE mechanism:
 *   - LOCAL: none in practice. install-helper.ts rewrites the script unconditionally at every boot
 *     of both shells, so a host running nodeterm is current as of its last start.
 *   - REMOTE: real. remote-hooks.ts writes it only inside RemoteHooks.setup(), which runs on
 *     CONNECT. An already-connected project keeps the script it was given, so its remote nodes —
 *     and any session the PHONE spawns on that host, which runs the host's installed script — stay
 *     `legacy` until the project reconnects.

 * `nt_tool` is read with parameter expansion (no subprocess, nothing on an argv) from the FIRST

 * quotes would be `\"` — so the only way to match an earlier one is a NESTED KEY inside an object
 * value, i.e. inside `tool_input`. Claude Code writes `tool_name` before `tool_input` (hook input
 * builder, research §1), so the first match is the top-level one; and if that order ever flips, the
 * `"tool_input"`-in-the-head check leaves `nt_tool` EMPTY rather than trusting a nested key. Empty is
 * the safe direction: the default hold and today's bare allow. The value is then held to a plain
 * identifier and only ever compared against two literals.

 * `nt_wait`: ExitPlanMode / AskUserQuestion are read by a person for minutes, so they hold
 * PERM_WAIT_SECS_INTERACTIVE (< the 600 s command-hook timeout our installers
 * write with an explicit `timeout: 600`, see CLAUDE_HOOK_EVENTS). EXCEPT for a subagent's request
 * (payload names an `agent_id`): Claude awaits a subagent's automated checks BEFORE painting its
 * dialog (research §1), so a long hold there would hide the prompt for minutes. Evidence that the
 * key is the right signal (claude 2.1.283 bundle, verified by the review): the hook base input is
 * `session_id…,permission_mode:r,agent_id:s?.agentId,agent_type:g,…` — `agentId` is undefined on
 * the main thread, so JSON.stringify drops the key there and it appears only for a subagent. A
 * nested `"agent_id":` inside tool_input merely shortens the hold — the safe direction.
