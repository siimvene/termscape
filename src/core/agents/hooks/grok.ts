// Grok hook service. The Grok hook config is a DIRECTORY — it merges every `$GROK_HOME/hooks/*.json`
// — so unlike claude and gemini there is no shared settings file to merge into: nodeterm owns one
// file outright and rewrites it. We still route through the shared install helper, because that is
// where the missing-script guard, the idempotent re-install and the "sweep events we no longer
// subscribe to" repair live.

 * Complete Grok 1.0.13 hook set, measured against
 * `~/.grok/docs/user-guide/10-hooks.md:84-106`. Keep all fifteen here: omitting an event makes its
 * normalizer unreachable, which is how StopCancelled existed but Esc left RUNNING stuck.
 * PreCompact/PostCompact are subscribed for their own sake, not for session identity. An earlier
 * version of this comment claimed grok mints a new session id during compaction and that both shells
 * must observe it. It does not: in the captured pair (1.0.13, 2026-09-01) `pre_compact` and
 * `post_compact` carry the SAME `sessionId`, and `docs/grok-agent.md`'s own dialect table already
 * said there is no id to re-key an association with. The claim was never measured; it read like a
 * measurement, and a branch was written against it.
