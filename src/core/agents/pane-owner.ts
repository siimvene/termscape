/**
 * WHO OWNS A PANE — read from the kernel, not from a name allowlist.
 *
 * The question this module answers is not `#{pane_current_command}`. That is one name, tmux's own
 * shallow reading of the pane's process, and it is wrong in both directions for a safety gate:
 *
 *  - measured on this host, a pane running the fake agent `…/fakebin/claude --resume x` (a
 *    `#!/usr/bin/env node` script) reports `#{pane_current_command}` = `node`. Every npm-installed
 *    agent CLI has that shape, so a name gate cannot tell claude from any other node process.
 *  - `isShellCommand` (`src/shared/agents/pane.ts`) is a SEVEN-name allowlist, so `!isShellCommand`
 *    — the old "this pane is an agent" gate — is true for `nu`, `pwsh`, `xonsh`, `elvish`, `ssh`
 *    and `python`. Text delivered there executes, because `sendText` appends Enter.
 *
 * The kernel already tracks the right thing: every terminal has a FOREGROUND PROCESS GROUP
 * (`tcgetpgrp`), and only that group can read the tty. Whatever is in it is what will receive the
 * bytes we are about to write. So: `#{pane_tty}` from tmux, then one `ps` on that tty, then the
 * argv of the group the kernel marks as the foreground one. Nothing here is spoofable by a
 * persisted field going stale.
 *
 * ── THE MEASUREMENT (Global Constraint: measure the shape, do not assume it) ────────────────────
 *
 * Run on this host, Linux 6.8, procps-ng 4.0.4, against a tmux session on a private socket
 * (2026-08-15):
 *
 *   $ tmux -L probe display-message -p -t owner-probe '#{pane_pid}|#{pane_tty}|#{pane_current_command}'
 *   2485382|/dev/pts/0|sh
 *   $ ps -ww -o pid=,pgid=,stat=,args= -t /dev/pts/0
 *   2485382 2485382 Ss   -bash                        <- the pane's own shell, NOT foreground
 *   2489089 2489089 S+   /bin/sh -c sleep 200 | cat   <- the foreground group, three members
 *   2489091 2489089 S+   sleep 200
 *   2489092 2489089 S+   cat
 *
 * Two facts the plan's sketch got wrong here, both measured rather than reasoned:
 *
 *  1. `ps -g <pgid>` does NOT select a process group on this procps. `-g` selects by SESSION or by
 *     effective group NAME, and the GNU long option `--pgid` does not exist (`error: unknown gnu
 *     long option`). So the Linux-specific "read `tpgid`, then `ps -g` that pgid" route does not
 *     work here at all, and a second round-trip would have bought nothing.
 *  2. Selecting by TTY works identically on Linux and BSD — `-t /dev/pts/0` and `-t pts/0` are both
 *     accepted — and `stat`'s `+` flag marks foreground-group membership on BOTH (procps STAT and
 *     BSD STAT define `+` the same way: "in the foreground process group of its controlling
 *     terminal"). `tpgid` is a procps-only column, so asking for it is what would have forced a
 *     `process.platform === 'darwin'` branch.
 *
 * Hence ONE invocation for both platforms — `ps -ww -o pid=,pgid=,stat=,args= -t <tty>` — and the
 * foreground group derived from the `+` flag rather than from a column only Linux has. `-ww` is
 * load-bearing on BSD, where `ps` truncates the command to the terminal width by default; a
 * truncated argv would hide the script path that names the agent.
 *
 * macOS was NOT reachable from the host this was measured on, so the darwin leg is unverified —
 * but it is unverified for a shape whose every piece is POSIX/BSD-documented, rather than for a
 * `tpgid` column BSD is documented not to have. **Mac verification owed.** If `ps` fails on some
 * platform, `parseForegroundArgv` answers `[]`, `PtyManager.paneOwner` answers `null`, and gate 1
 * refuses there — a refusal, never a guess.
 *
 * No credential is involved anywhere in this module — a tty path and a pid are the only inputs — so
 * Global Constraint 6 ("no credential on any argv") is trivially satisfied. Do not add one: if this
 * read ever needs to authenticate, it needs a stdin channel, not a flag.
