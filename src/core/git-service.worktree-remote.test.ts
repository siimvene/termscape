// GitService's worktree ops hand the shared ops a `pathExists` — and the only one this process has
// is `fs.existsSync`, which answers about THIS MACHINE and nothing else. But the `git()` executor
// they run through transparently routes to a REMOTE git over the project's ControlMaster whenever
// `resolveGitRemote` claims the cwd. Pairing the two would make every worktree the host lists stat
// as missing here → `prunable: true` for all of them → every bound group struck as missing, and
// `worktreeRemove` answering `worktreeGone` (the renderer's proof that a directory is gone: it
// destroys the descendant terminals' tmux sessions and rewrites their persisted cwds) for a
// worktree that is alive and well on the host.
//
// So the ops REFUSE for a remote repo. These tests pin the refusal, and — because a refusal that
// leaked into the local path would silently kill the whole feature — pin that a LOCAL repo (no
// resolver claiming it) still goes through to real git.
