// Executable resolution for a GUI process, without ever spawning a login shell SYNCHRONOUSLY.
//
// A GUI app launched from Finder/Dock inherits only a minimal PATH (`/usr/bin:/bin:…`) — it
// never sees Homebrew, `~/.local/bin`, nvm, etc. The historical fix was a sync
// `execFileSync($SHELL, ['-lc', 'command -v <bin>'])` per lookup, but sourcing the user's
// profile routinely takes 100-800ms (nvm/conda init) and a synchronous spawn of it sits on the
// MAIN thread — freezing every window, every PTY flush and all IPC for its duration (and the
// tmux-missing banner re-probes on a 3s poll, so it froze repeatedly).
//
// The replacement: resolve the login-shell PATH ONCE, asynchronously (`resolveShellPath`,
// prewarmed at boot), and make every lookup a subprocess-free walk of that cached PATH string
// (`findInPathString` — an accessSync per entry). Callers that run before the async probe has
// settled fall back to the inherited PATH plus their own well-known locations, and simply
// re-probe later (see each caller's memoization notes).

 * The names a bare `bin` can have ON DISK, in the order Windows itself tries them.
 *
 * Windows resolves a bare command against PATHEXT — `gh` on disk is `gh.exe`, `claude` is
 * `claude.exe`, an npm shim is `<name>.cmd`. Without this a PATH walk finds nothing at all there:
 * `path.join(dir, 'gh')` names a file that does not exist, and every caller then falls through to
 * its POSIX fallback list (`/usr/bin/...`), which does not exist either. The result was a silent
 * `null` for every lookup on Windows — and, downstream, no `gh`, no `ssh`, and a claude
 * capability probe that never ran.
 *
 * PATHEXT entries come FIRST and the bare name LAST, which is the order Windows itself resolves in
 * — and the order matters more than it looks. npm installs a global CLI as BOTH `<name>` (a POSIX
 * shell shim, for Git Bash) and `<name>.cmd` (for cmd) in the same directory. Trying the bare name
 * first hands back the shim, which `CreateProcess` cannot run: the spawn fails with a file that
 * plainly exists. The bare name is kept as a last resort because an extensionless PE is executable,
 * just not the thing to prefer. A `bin` that already carries a PATHEXT suffix is returned untouched
 * rather than growing a second one (`gh.exe.EXE`).
 *
 * The extension is appended with PATHEXT's OWN casing, which is conventionally upper case — so a
 * hit on `gh.exe` comes back as `...\gh.EXE`. That is the same file (Windows paths are
 * case-insensitive) and every consumer here spawns it rather than comparing it, so the alternative
 * — a readdir per directory to recover the on-disk spelling — buys nothing and would put I/O on a
 * function whose whole point is to stay cheap on the main thread.
 *
 * `platform` and `pathext` are parameters, not reads of the ambient process, so the mapping is
 * unit-testable from any OS — the same shape as `tmuxInstall(platform, hasCommand)` next door.
