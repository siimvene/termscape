// WHAT A CONTROL VERB DOES WHEN ITS OWN PROJECT IS NOT THE ONE ON SCREEN.
//
// IN `src/shared` BECAUSE IT HAS THREE SIDES, which is the whole reason this file exists rather
// than living beside the dispatch that reads it:
//
//   - the RENDERER's dispatch (`renderer/canvas/Canvas.tsx`, via `renderer/lib/controlRouting.ts`)
//     branches on it,
//   - CORE renders the agent-facing help from it (`core/canvas-control-core.ts` —
//     `buildCanvasSkillBody` and `buildCanvasControlInstructions`, the two texts orchestrating
//     agents actually read), and core cannot import the renderer,
//   - the cross-layer guard walks it against main's verb table
//     (`test/acceptance/control-verb-disposition.test.ts`).
//
// CLAUDE.md's rule for this subsystem is derive, never re-type: "a doc line with no such test is a
// plan, not a fact — see the drift that shipped as #269". A verb's off-screen behaviour is
// precisely the kind of fact a prose sentence forgets. So the table is here, once, and the help
// text is rendered from it.
//
// THE INVARIANT IT ENCODES: nothing an agent asks for may activate a project tab. Routing is by
// SOURCE — the request names the agent's own node, and the dispatch has to find the canvas that
// owns it — and for a long time the answer to "that canvas is not on screen" was to travel there.
// The user was typing in project B; a background agent in project A issued a `close`; the tab
// switched and A's SAVED viewport was applied, so their focus, camera and typing context were
// taken by a call they did not make. Two carve-outs were added over the years and each was
// written as if it were the last, because nothing walked the whole table.

/**
 * Verbs that are answered from the SERIALIZED store instead of the live canvas.
 *
 * `list` reads names only, and it is the verb an agent calls most — answering it out of the store
 * keeps a background agent's polling from yanking the user's view to another project tab on every
 * call.
 *
 * `send`/`reply` are here for a stronger reason than politeness, and it is worth being precise
 * about WHICH travel this prevents: routing here is by SOURCE
 * (`routeControlSource(projects, activeId, sourceNodeId)`), so what the declaration stops is a trip
 * to the SENDER's project — which an off-canvas orchestrator would otherwise trigger on every
 * message it sent, hijacking the human's view on a background agent's say-so and clearing that
 * node's unread badge via `setActive` on the way (G5). A delivery goes to a tmux PANE, not to a
 * canvas, so it needs no live canvas at either end.
 *
 * The other half — never travelling to the TARGET's project — is not this function's doing. It
 * comes from `resolveDeliveryScope` (`src/core/agents/agent-message-scope.ts`) taking the
 * serialized store and having no live-node parameter at all, so there is nothing to travel toward.
 *
 * LIVE AS OF PR 5: Canvas.tsx's dispatch handles `send`/`reply` BEFORE its source-routing
 * machinery, so neither `routeControlSource` nor any travel runs for them — the declaration here
 * and that early-exit are the same decision stated once each, and `controlRouting.test.ts` pins
 * this half.
 */
/*
 * `sticky` is store-answered for the send/reply reason, not the list reason: its headline use is
 * a SCHEDULED agent rewriting one note every few minutes, and routing is by SOURCE — so a live
 * requirement would yank the human's view to the sync agent's project on every run (G5), which is
 * exactly the behaviour that gets the sync loop turned off. The write lands in the owning
 * project's serialized nodes (`applyNodeMutation`, the same path peer mutations take) when that
 * project is not the active one; the live canvas handles it when it is.
 */
/*
 * `open-project` (issue #338) is store-answered for the G5 reason in its sharpest form: its
 * headline caller is a background orchestrator registering one repo after another, and routing is
 * by SOURCE — a live requirement would yank the human's view to the CALLER's project on every
 * registration (and clear its unread badge via `setActive` on the way). The verb acts on the
 * projects STORE through the non-activating `registerProject`, and its consent dialog is
 * app-global (`ConfirmState` overlays the window), so no live canvas is needed at either end.
 * Canvas.tsx handles it BEFORE the source-routing machinery — this declaration and that
 * early-exit are the same decision stated once each (spec §2.3, P6), pinned by
 * `controlRouting.test.ts`.
 */
/*
 * `notify` rides in `send`/`reply`'s early-exit block and always has — it is the same delivery
 * with a different destination (an OS notification rather than a pane), so no canvas is needed at
 * either end. It was simply never DECLARED here, which made it invisible to anything reasoning
 * about the table; `test/acceptance/control-verb-disposition.test.ts` is what found it. Declaring
 * it changes no behaviour (it returns above the routing block), and undeclaring it again would
 * make the only verb whose code and table disagree.

 *
 * The relationship to `STORE_ANSWERED_VERBS` is the whole point, and the two sets are disjoint
 * (pinned in `controlRouting.test.ts`):
 *
 *   - `STORE_ANSWERED_VERBS` — "no canvas is needed at either end". `list` reads names, `send`/
 *     `reply` deliver into a tmux PANE, `sticky` rewrites a note, `open-project` acts on the
 *     projects store. `needsLiveCanvas` is false for them and they never route at all.
 *   - `COLD_OPENABLE_VERBS` — "a canvas IS needed, but the serialized one will do". The node these
 *     verbs create is INERT until its project is next shown: the launch command moves into
 *     `pendingLaunch` (`armForColdOpen`), the node is upserted through `applyNodeMutation`, and the
 *     project's own mount path spawns the PTY and fires the armed launch. `needsLiveCanvas` stays
 *     TRUE for them — they do need a canvas — which is exactly why this is a second, narrower set
 *     rather than four more entries in the first one.
 *
 * WHY (the bug): routing is by SOURCE, so `open-claude` from an agent in a project the user is not
 * looking at travelled the user's view to that project — the camera jumped, the tab switched and
 * the target project's saved viewport was applied, all on a background agent's say-so. That is the
 * same G5 hijack `send`/`reply`/`sticky` are declared here to avoid; the difference is only that an
 * open needs somewhere to put the node, and a project's serialized nodes are somewhere.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT here: every verb that acts on nodes that already exist. Those split between
 * the FOURTH set below (`STORED_NODE_VERBS` — they reach a pane, a store writer or a board, none
 * of which needs React Flow) and an outright refusal (`OFF_SCREEN_REFUSALS` — the structural verbs
 * read live canvas state the serialized copy does not carry: measured node sizes, worktree
 * staleness, a mounted webview). Neither travels. The verbs that create a node with no session

 *
 * The third set, and the reason it is not folded into `COLD_OPENABLE_VERBS`: a cold open has a
 * launch to defer, so it moves the composed command into `pendingLaunch` and tells the caller the
 * session is QUEUED. These four have nothing to defer. A web page, a video, an image and a browser
 * node are inert wherever they sit; writing one into a project's serialized nodes is the whole
 * effect, and it is complete the moment `writeDisk` returns. One set with two contracts inside it
 * is how a caller ends up told a picture is queued.
 *
 * WHY they were still travelling after the cold-open fix: an agent that renders its output as a
 * node — a report as `show-web`, a screenshot as `show-image` — is the commonest reason a
 * background session touches the canvas at all, and every one of those calls yanked the human out
 * of the project they were typing in. Same G5 objection, same answer as the two sets above.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT here: `browser`, which NAVIGATES an existing node and needs a mounted
 * `<webview>` guest to do it. `open-browser` merely places the node; the guest is created when
 * that project is next shown, exactly as a cold-opened terminal's PTY is.
 *
 * None of the four takes `--group`, which is why this set owes no worktree question. A verb
 * joining it that does would: `cwdForNewNodeIn` subtracts the worktree store's `staleGroupIds`,
 * which is epoch-scoped to the ACTIVE project, so off canvas that subtraction cannot be made.

/**

 *
 * THE BUG, in full. Routing is by SOURCE, and until this set existed everything outside the three
 * sets above fell through to `travelToProject`. So: the user is typing in project B; a background
 * agent in project A — a scheduled run, an orchestrator, a session re-adopted at boot — issues a
 * `close`, a `write`, a `rename`. The tab switches, project A's SAVED viewport is applied, and the
 * camera appears to jump. Their focus, their camera and their typing context are taken by a call
 * they did not make. Twenty-one verbs did it; the two carve-outs above were added without anyone
 * noticing the rest, because nothing pinned the whole table.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES THESE FOUR-PLUS-THREE ANSWERABLE OFF SCREEN: none of them needs React Flow. Each one
 * reaches something that is screen-independent and has a serialized counterpart:
 *
 *   - `write` reaches a tmux PANE through main and never touches the canvas at all — it does not
 *     so much as look a node up. It is on this list only because it used to travel to get here.
 *   - `close` ends a tmux session (`transport.destroy` resolves a REMOTE node's host from the
 *     persisted index, with no live client — see core/remote-end.ts) and drops the node through
 *     the store's `removeNode`. That is the cross-project teardown the sessions sidebar has always
 *     used for a node in a project that is not on screen; `closeStoredNodes` is now the one copy.
 *   - `rename` / `color` have dedicated store writers (`renameNode` / `recolorNode`) that mutate
 *     the serialized node directly, with no round-trip through the serializers.
 *   - `link` writes persisted `bridges`, which `appendCanvasLinks` appends to a non-active project —
 *     the same call the cold open already makes for the rope and bridge it owes.
 *   - `board` is a read, and `assign` writes board METADATA through `setProjectKanban`. Both used
 *     to read `activeProjectId`, which off canvas was a second bug hiding behind the first: after
 *     the travel the two projects were the same, so the wrong read was never wrong in practice.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT here — and these REFUSE rather than travel, see `offScreenDisposition`: the

 * screen, and every one of these would have to guess at something the serialized copy does not
 * carry.
