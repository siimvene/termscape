/**
 * A canvas node's user-chosen icon: one emoji/character, or a small image file.
 *
 * The value is persisted in `.nodeterm/project.json`, which is git-shared, hand-editable and —
 * for an SSH project — a file on the remote host. So nothing here trusts its input: every value
 * that reaches a render or a filesystem read goes through `normalizeNodeIcon` FIRST, at the point
 * of use, exactly as `permissionModeFlag` re-validates a permission mode and `safeSessionProgram`
 * re-validates a session program. The TypeScript type is a compile-time claim about our own
 * writers; it says nothing about a file someone cloned.
 *
 * Three rules, and each one is the answer to a specific way this could go wrong:
 *
 *  1. **An emoji is ONE grapheme.** Without a cap, `"icon": {"type":"emoji","value":"<40kB>"}`
 *     in a shared project file is a blob rendered into every node header, every kanban card and
 *     every sidebar row. Truncating is safe (the user sees a shorter icon than they typed);
 *     refusing outright would drop a perfectly good four-person ZWJ family emoji, which is 11
 *     UTF-16 units and would fail any naive length check.
 *
 *  2. **An image path must LOOK like an image.** The extension gate is what stops a hostile
 *     project.json from aiming `fs.readBinary` at `~/.ssh/id_rsa`. It is not a complete jail —
 *     the file can still name any *.png on the machine, exactly as an editor node's `filePath`
 *     always could — but the bytes only ever become an `<img>` in a renderer with a `'self'` CSP
 *     and no network, so the reachable outcome is "an icon fails to draw", not exfiltration.
 *
 *  3. **A relative path may not traverse.** `./` paths are resolved against the project cwd (see
 *     below), so a `./..`-prefixed one would walk straight out of the project. Same rule, and the
 *     same reasoning, as `isSafeQuickOpenRelPath` on the remote quick-open index. **Both `/` and
 *     `\\` count as separators when that rule is applied, on every platform** — see
 *     `isSafeRelIconPath`.
 *
 * **Two dialects in, one dialect out.** The value is written by one machine and read by another,
 * so validation ACCEPTS a Windows path (`C:\\...`) and a POSIX one (`/...`) regardless of where
 * the check runs, while everything this module STORES is POSIX-separated. Both halves are
 * load-bearing:
 *
 *  • Accepting both everywhere is what stops a mac's `flowToNodeStates` from silently deleting a
 *    Windows teammate's icons: refuse `C:\\...` on mac and a mac user merely opening the shared
 *    canvas and saving it strips them from `project.json`. A Windows absolute path on a mac does
 *    not RESOLVE, of course — it just does not draw, exactly as a POSIX absolute path from someone
 *    else's machine already does not. That is a degrade, and a degrade is not a reason to destroy
 *    the value on the way past.
 *  • Storing one dialect is what makes the `./` form portable at all. A stored `.\\a\\b.png` would
 *    mean "a file called `a\\b.png`" on POSIX and "`b.png` inside `a`" on Windows. So
 *    `normalizeNodeIcon` canonicalizes a relative path to `./` with forward slashes, the same way
 *    it canonicalizes an emoji to its first grapheme.
 *
 * **Portability.** An icon image lives beside the canvas that names it, in the project's own
 * git-shared `.nodeterm/images/` (see core/canvas-images.ts). A path stored absolutely would
 * therefore travel to a teammate as a path only the author's machine has — the file arrives, the
 * icon does not. So a path under the project cwd is stored `./`-relative and resolved on read,
 * which is the convention `toPortableNodes` already established for node cwds. Everything else
 * (a cwd-less canvas, an SSH project, the app-local fallback `saveCanvasImage` takes when the
 * project folder will not accept the write) stays absolute and simply does not travel — the same
 * degrade canvas image nodes take, and not an error.
