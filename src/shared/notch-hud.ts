// macOS Notch HUD — the user-tunable PLACEMENT values and their sanitizers (docs/notch-hud.md).
//
// Shared because two sides consume the same numbers: main clamps them at the point of use
// (`notch-hud.ts` → `hudGeometry` / `hudPlacement`), and Settings → Notch draws its controls from
// the same bounds, so the slider range and the clamp can never drift apart (they used to be two
// hand-copied constants with a "keep in sync" comment).
//
// Every value here comes from settings.json, which is hand-editable — a hostile input. Nothing
// trusts the TypeScript type: `sanitize*` re-validates at runtime and an unrecognised value falls
// back to the default, never to a guess.
