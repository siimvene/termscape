// A board comment that @mentions a session node is delivered to that agent through the agent
// messaging core (src/core/agents/agent-messaging.ts, `deliverBoardCommentFromUi`). This file is the
// part three places must agree on: the comment composer that inserts a mention, the main-process
// handler that decides what reaches the pane, and the feed that renders the token and the outcome.
//
// ── WHO MAY TRIGGER A DELIVERY ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Only the local user, typing in THIS app. A comment is text in `.nodeterm/board-log.jsonl`, which
// is shared: a git pull, another instance writing the file, a relay peer or a team-presence guest can
// all put a comment carrying mention tokens into it. None of those may type into a local pane —
// that is cross-user prompt injection. So a delivery is started only by the composer's own send
// handler, with the text the user just typed, and NOTHING that reads the log (load, change push,
// render) has a path to it. A token that arrives in the file is display-only, forever.
//
// ── THE TOKEN ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `@[<label>](node:<id>)`. The id is the authority; the label is only a fallback for rendering a
// node that no longer exists. The id alphabet is `isSafeNodeId`'s, so a token can never name an id
// the messaging scope would refuse as unaddressable, and a label can hold no bracket or control
// character, so a title cannot close the label early and name a different id.
