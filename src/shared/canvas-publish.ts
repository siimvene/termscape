// Canvas sync — the emitting side.
//
// The renderer holds its nodes in React Flow (the single live source of truth). This publisher turns
// successive serialized snapshots of that list into the minimal CanvasMutation stream for the peers:
//
//   publish(states)                  → diff vs the last published snapshot, send each mutation
//   publish(states, {throttle:true}) → a drag frame: at most one send per PUBLISH_INTERVAL_MS
//   adopt(states)                    → LOOP GUARD: take the snapshot as baseline, send NOTHING
//
// Snapshots, NOT React Flow change-lists: a rename, a color pick, a collapse and an add all reach the
// nodes array through direct setNodes(...) calls that never pass through onNodesChange, so a
// change-list-driven publisher would silently fail to sync half the edits. Diffing the serialized
// snapshot catches every one of them, whatever path produced it.
//
// `adopt` is what stops an infinite echo: when a mutation arrives FROM a peer, Canvas applies it and
// adopts the result, so the React effect that fires for the resulting `nodes` change diffs to nothing.
// (Same shape as the existing `loadingRef` suppression that keeps a programmatic project load from
// marking the project dirty.) Without it, A's mutation applied on B would be re-published by B to C
// (and back at A) forever. The other half of the anti-loop is canvas-order, which never *applies* a
// client's own echoed-back mutation in the first place.
//
// Pure + DOM-free (vitest runs in the node environment): only setTimeout, no React, no window.

 * a thunk lets it be paid only when a snapshot is actually going to be diffed or sent.

 * immutable array per change, so `() => serialize(nodes)` satisfies this): the publisher may
 * resolve it later — at the trailing edge of a throttle window, or when the first peer arrives.

 *   as the baseline and returns: no stableStringify of every node (~1.4 ms at 100 nodes, and the
 *   `nodes` array changes at 60 Hz during a drag), no IPC cast, no work in the main process. A solo
 *   user must not pay for a feature they cannot use. The baseline still tracks the canvas, so the
 *   instant a peer joins the very next edit diffs correctly against what is actually on screen —
 *   there is no resync step and no missed mutation. Default: always publish.
 *
 *   With a thunk snapshot the gate covers the SERIALIZATION too, which is where the cost actually
 *   was: a solo baseline is kept UNRESOLVED (just the thunk), and the first publish that has a peer
 *   resolves it to diff against. Same baseline, same mutations — the work is merely deferred to the
 *   moment something reads it, which for a solo user is never.
