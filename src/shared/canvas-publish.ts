// Canvas sync — the emitting side.
//
// The renderer holds its nodes in React Flow (the single live source of truth). This publisher turns
// successive serialized snapshots of that list into the minimal CanvasMutation stream for the peers:
//
//   publish(states)                  → diff vs the last published snapshot, send each mutation
//   publish(states, {throttle:true}) → a drag frame: at most one send per PUBLISH_INTERVAL_MS
//   adopt(states)                    → LOOP GUARD: take the snapshot as baseline, send NOTHING
//
// Snapshots, NOT React Flow change-lists: a rename, a color pick, a collapse and an add all reach the
// nodes array through direct setNodes(...) calls that never pass through onNodesChange, so a
// change-list-driven publisher would silently fail to sync half the edits. Diffing the serialized
// snapshot catches every one of them, whatever path produced it.
//
// `adopt` is what stops an infinite echo: when a mutation arrives FROM a peer, Canvas applies it and
// adopts the result, so the React effect that fires for the resulting `nodes` change diffs to nothing.
// (Same shape as the existing `loadingRef` suppression that keeps a programmatic project load from
// marking the project dirty.) Without it, A's mutation applied on B would be re-published by B to C
// (and back at A) forever. The other half of the anti-loop is canvas-order, which never *applies* a
// client's own echoed-back mutation in the first place.
//
// Pure + DOM-free (vitest runs in the node environment): only setTimeout, no React, no window.
