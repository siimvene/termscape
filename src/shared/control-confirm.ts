// The human gate in front of a canvas-control agent's DESTRUCTIVE verbs: who may waive the
// confirm dialog, for how long, and what may never waive it.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL. The confirm dialog raised by `write` / `close` / `open-project`
// (Canvas.tsx's control dispatch) is the only place a human stands between an agent holding
// NODETERM_CANVAS_CONTROL and the user's workspace. Per-node identity is not fully enforced until
// `NODE_IDENTITY_STRICT_AFTER` (docs/node-identity.md), so until then a `legacy` caller — one we
// cannot judge — still reaches that dispatch. Everything here loosens that gate, so every rule is
// written to fail CLOSED, and every loosening is a setting the user can see and revoke.
//
// SURFACES. This is the DESKTOP gate and only the desktop gate. Server Edition canvas control
// (opt-in, `NODETERM_SERVER_CANVAS_CONTROL=1`) is HEADLESS and has no dialog to waive: its
// `close` is gated by verified node identity plus process-local creator ownership
// (`HeadlessNodeFactory.close` — "did this caller spawn that node during this server run"), which
// is a different mechanism, not a weaker copy of this one. Nothing here loosens it, and a waiver
// must never be plumbed into it: the server's rule does not ask a human at all, so "the human
// said don't ask again" has nothing to attach to. Mobile is N/A (the phone issues no control
// verbs).
//
// IN `src/shared` for the same two-sided reason as `control-verbs.ts`: the renderer decides
// (Canvas.tsx + the Settings section) and main owns the request timeout the expiry reads, and
// `tsconfig.web` gives the renderer no path into `src/main` or `src/core`.
