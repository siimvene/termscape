/**
 * What the phone-pairing surfaces show in place of (or beside) the QR — ONE decision shared by
 * Settings → Phone and the quick-pair popover, so the two cannot disagree about when a code is
 * scannable.
 *
 * Two kinds of host:
 *  - SSH hosts (macOS, Linux): the scan installs an SSH key, so the QR waits for sshd — a pairing
 *    against a dead sshd installs a key the phone can never use.
 *  - Relay-only hosts (Windows, `sshKey: false`): the phone cannot drive a Windows host over SSH
 *    (its commands are POSIX sh + tmux; Windows OpenSSH hands out cmd.exe and sessions live in the
 *    session host), so no key is installed and sshd is irrelevant. The QR waits for the RELAY
 *    instead, because without it the pairing would give the phone nothing to connect with.
