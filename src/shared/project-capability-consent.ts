/**
 * The one-time clone notice, decided ONCE for every capability — pure, shared, and the only
 * decider either feature may use (browser control here in PR 3; agent messaging adopts it in its
 * PR 6 without reimplementing anything).
 *
 * A switch that arrives from a clone is not the same thing as a switch the user set:
 * `.nodeterm/project.json` is git-shared and hand-editable, so `agentBrowserControl: true` in a
 * freshly cloned repo is a stranger's decision until this machine's user has seen it. The
 * acknowledgment is therefore recorded MACHINE-LOCALLY (`IndexEntryV3.capabilityAck` — the index
 * entry is the only authority for project identity), never in the shared file; a second worktree
 * of the same repo is a second entry, hence a second notice, on purpose.
 *
 * THE ACK CARRIES THE ANSWER, not just the fact of one (PR #213 review, C1). "Turn it off" can
 * only delete the field from THIS working copy — the hostile `true` survives in git and a routine
 * `git checkout`/pull restores it. If the ack were a bare bit, that restored `true` would meet a
 * standing acknowledgment and grant silently to a user who explicitly said no. So:
 *   - `'kept'`     — explicit consent; enabled+kept is the ONE granting combination.
 *   - `'declined'` — explicit refusal; if the file's `true` ever re-arrives it is refused AND a
 *                    NEW notice is raised (never silence, never a grant without a fresh "keep").
 *   - absent       — never answered (or dismissed without answering — dismissal is not an answer);
 *                    enabled+absent is a pending notice and a refusal.
 * Each rule is pinned by `project-capability-consent.test.ts`.
 *
 * Lives in `src/shared` for the same reason as `safe-id.ts`: the renderer raises the dialog and may
 * not import `src/core`; `core/project-capability-consent.ts` re-exports these for main/core
 * callers, and its test pins that the two paths are the same function objects.
