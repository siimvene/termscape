  // The successor to the legacy `remote:host:*` dialect above (the `remote:client:*` desktop-client
  // channels were deleted in Task 10; the desktop client is now the `relay:*` tunnel). The phone
  // still speaks `remote:host:*` until the iOS repo migrates (docs/ios-protocol-migration.md), so
  // these deliberately use a distinct `relay:*` namespace. A connected peer is a first-class
  // CorePlatform client: the client casts raw rpc.ts frames (JSON strings) at the host and receives
  // frames back, rather than a bespoke per-verb channel set.
  //
