 *    active Pro plan." + Upgrade.
 *  - `limit-machine` — 5 links active on this machine (checked locally, before any request).
 *  - `limit-active` / `limit-daily` / `rate-limited` — the API's 429, by scope.
 *  - `network` — a timeout, a thrown fetch, a 5xx or a malformed reply. Never "you are offline":
 *    "Couldn't reach nodeterm's service. Nothing was shared."
 *  - `license-check` — the API could not check the license right now (503).
 *  - `relay-unavailable` — relaying is disabled in this build (an unpackaged dev build).
 *  - `node-missing` — no project holds the node (a node opened seconds ago may not be saved yet:
 *    flush the canvas save before asking).
 *  - `bad-request` — the request did not validate (here or at the API).
 *  - `persist-failed` — the server row was created but could not be written locally; it was revoked.
 *  - `unsupported` — this surface cannot create links: the Server Edition until it has a license
 *    layer ("Live links need a Pro license on this server — not available in the Server Edition
 *    yet", never an Upgrade button — R43), a relay tab ("Live links are created on the machine that
 *    runs this terminal"), a client that is not the machine's owner, or an app that is quitting. Also
 *    a Control link whose password this machine could not hash (scrypt failed; nothing was created
 *    anywhere): the desktop copy names no cause, and every other kind names one that is not it.
 *  - `ttl-unsupported` — the API refused an Unlimited link (an older server): pick an end time.
 *  - `control-unsupported` — a Control link on a terminal that cannot take typed input safely (a
 *    Zellij session, whose key bindings would reach every session).
 *  - `bad-password` — a Control link without an acceptable password.
