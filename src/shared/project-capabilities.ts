/**
 * Per-project capability switches — the FIRST of their kind in nodeterm.
 *
 * Before this file, `Project` carried exactly two policy fields (defaultAccountId,
 * defaultPermissionMode) and there was no per-project settings surface at all. Browser control
 * needed one and agent-to-agent messaging needs the same one, so the mechanism lives here ONCE:
 * the key set, the copy, the strict read, and the file round-trip. Adding a capability is a line in
 * PROJECT_CAPABILITIES plus an entry in PROJECT_CAPABILITY_COPY — no persistence code changes and,
 * critically, no second clone-notice implementation (see core/project-capability-consent.ts).
 *
 * THESE FIELDS LIVE IN .nodeterm/project.json, WHICH IS GIT-SHARED. That is a hazard to be handled,
 * not noted: a hostile cloned repo ships `agentBrowserControl: true` and the clone's first agent
 * turn would otherwise hold the capability. Two things make that survivable and BOTH are required:
 *
 *  1. The switch alone grants nothing. Every capability must additionally require state this app
 *     run built and never persisted (browser control: the in-memory ownership ledger; a cloned
 *     project.json cannot pre-populate it, and `Project.ropes` — which IS persisted and git-shared —
 *     is deliberately never consulted for ownership).
 *  2. First use in a project the user has not personally switched on raises a one-time notice,
 *     recorded MACHINE-LOCALLY (IndexEntryV3.capabilityAck), never in project.json.
 *
 * If (2) is ever dropped as friction, this field must move to a machine-local store. That is the
 * trigger, written down where the decision is, not only in the design doc.
 *
 * ── MACHINE DEFAULTS (agentMessaging only) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A capability may name a MACHINE-LOCAL default in settings.json (`CAPABILITY_MACHINE_DEFAULTS`)
 * that answers for a project whose file carries NO value. This does not trip the trigger above,
 * and the reason is the whole design: (2) is not dropped — a literal `true` in the file still
 * grants only with this machine's `'kept'` answer, so a stranger's `true` still raises the notice.
 * What the default decides is ABSENCE, and absence is not something a clone can hand anyone: the
 * value that answers it lives in this machine's own settings.json, set by this machine's user. A
 * hostile repo can at most OMIT the field, which yields exactly what the user already chose for
 * every project they did not configure.
 *
 * Absence therefore stops meaning "off" for such a capability, so OFF has to be written: the file
 * carries a literal `false` (`projectCapabilityFileState` → `'off'`), which beats any default. And a
 * recorded `'declined'` keeps an absent field off too — that is how every pre-default build wrote
 * "turn it off" (delete the field + decline), and a user's explicit no must not be undone by a
 * default they turned on later.
