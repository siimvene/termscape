 * else. Hence one function rather than the rule written out at each site.
 *
 * ## Why the project's binding wins on a HOST match, user and port included
 *
 * A node's `ssh` is a SNAPSHOT persisted into the canvas, and an SSH project's canvas lives in
 * `<remoteCwd>/.nodeterm/project.json` ON THE HOST — shared with everyone who opens that folder.
 * So the `user` (and port) on a node is whoever created it, not whoever is reading it: alice's
 * nodes say `alice@box`, and when bob opens the same project as `bob@box` every one of them would
 * ask for a second master dialing `alice@box` — which fails for bob, or worse sits on an askpass
 * prompt. The project's binding is the authority on how THIS user reaches that machine, so a node
 * naming the same host is served by it.
 *
 * The cost is a deliberate one: inside an SSH project you cannot pin a node to a second ACCOUNT on
 * the same host. A different machine still gets its own attachment, which is the case this is for.
