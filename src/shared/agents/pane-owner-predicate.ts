 *                 read through, because the kernel tracks that per terminal, not per process.
 *  - `command`  — `#{pane_current_command}`, tmux's own shallow answer. Kept because it is free and
 *                 because it is what the old gate used; it is NOT what the predicate decides on.
 *                 Measured on this host: a pane running `node …/claude --resume x` reports

/**
 * POSITIVE and kernel-truth, replacing `!isShellCommand(pane)`, which was neither.
 *
 * The old gate asked a persisted field what the pane SHOULD be running. `agentId` is durable and
 * outlives the CLI, so a plain terminal whose claude exited weeks ago still read as an agent — and
 * `isShellCommand` is a SEVEN-NAME allowlist (zsh/bash/sh/fish/dash/ksh/tcsh), so `nu`, `pwsh`,
 * `xonsh`, `ssh` and `python` all fell through its negation and were admitted as agents. Text
 * delivered to any of those EXECUTES, because sendText appends Enter.
 *
 * `unknown` is a third answer, not a shade of `not-agent`, because the two need different replies:
 * `unknown` means the probe failed and the caller may retry; `not-agent` means the kernel answered
 * and the answer was no.
 *
 * Matched on the BASENAME of argv[0] (after interpreter resolution), never on a substring of the
 * command line — `vim /etc/claude.conf` and `grep -r claude .` are not claude panes.
 *
 * `binaries` overrides the derived list. A caller holding the settings should pass
 * `binariesFor(agentId, settings.customAgents)` so a CUSTOM agent is verifiable too; without it a
 * `custom:<uuid>` cannot be named and answers `unknown`, which is a refusal, not a licence.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS DOES NOT PROVE (carry into the delivery gate) ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *  1. **It proves the agent is IN the foreground process group, not that it is the thing READING
 *     the tty.** `sh -c "sleep 600 | claude"` answers `agent`, and correctly so — claude really is
 *     in the group. But claude's stdin is the PIPE, so text written to the pane sits in the tty
 *     buffer until the shell reads it after the pipeline exits. That is the "rename splice = lost
 *     launch" shape: the write succeeds and the payload surfaces later, somewhere else. A gate that
 *     needs "the agent is reading" needs a further check; this predicate is not it.
 *  2. **Two false negatives are terminal and deliberate**, documented rather than fixed because the
 *     alternative is guessing: a script path containing a SPACE (the argv split cannot tell it from
 *     two tokens), and a differently-named SYMLINK to the agent binary (argv carries the name it
 *     was invoked as, not the target). Both answer `not-agent` — a refusal, which is the safe
 *     direction.
 *
 * `isShellCommand` is deliberately NOT deleted — its existing callers (the restart exit poll, the
 * reconnect resync) ask a genuinely different question ("has the CLI let go of the pane?") for
 * which a shell allowlist is the right shape.
