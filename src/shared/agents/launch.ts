// Pure command assembly — the ONE place an agent's launch / resume command line is built.
//
// Used by the renderer only: fresh node creation (`workspace.ts createAgentNode`), cold-restore /
// wake / variant resume (`TerminalNode.tsx`), and the Settings command preview
// (`CustomAgentsSection.tsx`). Pure: the environment is an explicit parameter, and every caller
// passes the SAME boot-time snapshot (src/renderer/lib/agentEnv.ts) — one assembler, one env, so
// the preview cannot drift from the real launch by construction. There is deliberately no
// main/server preview IPC: an endpoint that expands ${env:…} for a caller-supplied agent record
// is an environment-variable oracle for relay peers (the #171/#190 review).
//
// Inheritance: a custom agent with a `baseAgent` resolves its prompt convention, separator, and
// capability flags through that base harness (`capabilityAgentId`), so a claude-compatible proxy
// gets `--permission-mode` / `--session-id` / `--resume` exactly as claude does — while its own
// `launchCmd`, `args`, and `env` override the binary and the surroundings.
