// Per-agent translation of nodeterm's permission mode into the agent's own approval flag.
//
// claude and grok share one spelling and one vocabulary, which is why they needed no mapping at all
// until now. gemini and codex each have their own, and BOTH are narrower than ours — which is the
// interesting case: our five modes fit neither `default|auto_edit|yolo|plan` nor
// `untrusted|on-request|never`, so a mode the CLI cannot express emits NO flag (its own default)
// rather than a nearest match. A silent substitution would show the user "Plan" while codex ran in
// on-request, or "Auto" while gemini auto-approved every file edit.
//
// Measured: `gemini --help` (0.54.4) and `codex --help` (0.146.0). `--sandbox` is deliberately not
// touched: it is a separate axis (read-only | workspace-write | danger-full-access), and folding
// `danger-full-access` into `bypassPermissions` would widen filesystem access invisibly —
// `--ask-for-approval never` on its own still sandboxes.

  // collapse two dropdown entries onto one behaviour — the same dishonesty this module exists to
  // remove, just expressed as an unflagged claim instead of a substituted flag. `untrusted` is the

 * (claude, gemini, codex) it goes LAST, keeping those command lines byte-identical; with one
 * (grok's `--`) it must go BEFORE the separator, because `--` is end-of-options.
 *
 * **A flag the command already carries is left alone (issue #601).** `cmd` is not always ours:
 * `settings.agentLaunchCommands` lets the user replace the program part with a wrapper, and a
 * wrapper may spell the approval flag itself. Appending regardless produced
 * `claude --permission-mode bypassPermissions --permission-mode auto` — a duplicate the settings
 * field still displayed as exactly what the user typed, so whichever occurrence the CLI honoured,
 * they had no way to tell which one was in force.
 *
 * The contract this settles is "program only, minus what you spelled yourself", not "the override
 * owns the whole command". The whole-command reading cannot work: the settings copy already
 * promises that `--resume` and friends are appended, and a wrapper has no way to know the session id
 * a cold restore is resuming — so nodeterm has to keep appending. What it must not do is append a
 * SECOND opinion about a flag the user has already stated one about; theirs is the more specific and
 * the more explicit, and it wins.
 *
 * Deliberately not extended to `withAgentModel`: a model switch is a per-node action the user just
 * took, and letting a global launch-command override veto it would silently strand that node on the
 * wrapper's model. Different specificity, opposite answer.
 *
 * A command with no override cannot reach the suppression — nodeterm builds it and never puts the
 * flag in twice — so every existing launch line is byte-identical.
