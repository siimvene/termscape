// Structured answers to a HELD Claude PermissionRequest (docs/hook-reply-approvals.md).
//
// The managed hook holds a PermissionRequest open and polls an answer file. The legacy answer is
// one word, `allow` | `deny`. That cannot answer the two tools that set `requiresUserInteraction`:
// Claude Code DROPS a bare allow for them (`if(!I.updatedInput&&e.requiresUserInteraction?.())
// return null` — docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-26-answer-paths-research.md §2), so approving a plan
// or answering a question needs a decision that carries `updatedInput`. These are the shapes the
// renderer may ask for; core (`core/agents/permission-decision.ts`) validates every field against the
// pending request file and builds the JSON the hook prints. The renderer never builds hook JSON.
//
// Shared (not core) because the renderer and both shells' IPC types name it.

 *    a hook `setMode auto` skips that strip (research §2(A)).
 *  - `plan-revise` — "No, keep planning": a deny whose message is the user's feedback.

 *    option label, a string[] is several labels of a multiSelect question. A key listed in
