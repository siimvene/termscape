// Host service — serve local PTYs over the relay (main process).
//
// On "host mode" the app: (1) gates on a valid Pro entitlement, (2) mints a single-use
// pairing token from our API with the stored entitlement, (3) connects to the relay as the
// HOST (so it becomes the pending host the client later joins to trigger the bridge), and
// (4) returns the pairing OFFER string for the user to hand to a client.
//
// While connected, the host maps the client's E2EE RPC/frames onto the existing pty-manager:
//   - RPC `pty.create {cols, rows, cwd?, shell?, persistKey?, agentId?}` -> `createDetached`,
//     returning `{ streamId }`. The PTY's output is piped into `OP.Output` frames; its exit
//     into an `OP.Error` frame (then the stream is dropped).
//   - `OP.Input`  frame -> `write(sessionId, <utf-8 payload>)`
//   - `OP.Resize` frame -> `resize(sessionId, cols, rows)` (payload = 2x uint16 LE)
//   - RPC `pty.kill {streamId}` -> `kill(null, sessionId)` (null = the relay owns this pty; it has
//     no UI subscribers, so dropping its sinks releases it — the tmux session keeps running)
//   - RPC `pty.destroy {streamId}` -> the injected `destroyNode` (the phone's "End session"):
//     permanently ends the stream's tmux session and takes the node off its canvas — the same two
//     steps the desktop × performs. The target is resolved from the stream, never client params.
// Output backpressure: when `sendFrame` returns false the host pauses the PTY via `setFlow`
// and resumes it on the next successful send.
//
// This file is glue over already-tested units (relay-socket, framing, pairing, pty-manager).
// The pure RPC/frame -> pty-manager mapping lives in `createHostHandlers` so it is unit-
// testable with fakes; `initRemoteHost` wires it to IPC, the license gate, and the API call.

   * The phone's "End session": permanently end the stream's tmux session and remove its node from
   * the canvas, via the injected `destroyNode` — the same path the desktop × takes. Three rules:
   * - The target is the STREAM's `persistKey`, never a client-sent node id: a client can only
   *   destroy a session it has actually attached to (post-approval), the same envelope every
   *   other session-scoped RPC here lives in.
   * - The viewer is dropped in the SAME synchronous turn as the destroy begins (the R4 adjacency
   *   rule): a late Input frame must never be written into a session on its way out.
   * - The answer is honest. `destroyNode` absent, an unknown streamId, or a failed destroy all
   *   respond `ok:false` with a message the phone can show — never an unconditional success.
   * - The answer is VERIFIED (issue #581). The destroy chain deliberately swallows per-step
   *   failures ("session may not exist on this socket" is a normal case for its kill fan-out), so
   *   `destroyNode` resolving proves only that nothing threw — measured: with tmux unresolved the
   *   whole kill block is skipped and the verb answered success over a session still running. So
   *   the OUTCOME is probed: `sessionExists` after the destroy must say gone. Its fail-safe
   *   direction (unprobeable ⇒ exists) is exactly right here — a destructive verb must not report
   *   success on uncertainty (the `confirmedTmuxSessionExists` rule, applied one layer up).
