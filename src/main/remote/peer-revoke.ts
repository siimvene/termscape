// THE revoke primitive for relay peers: unpin a box public key AND close every live session that
// key authenticated. Every revoke path goes through `revokePeerKey` — phone "Remove"
// (pairing-service.ts), the Team Access seat revoke (relay-host-service.ts) and the
// `remote:revoke-peer` control channel (index.ts) — so none of them can do half of it.
//
// Why both halves (revocation.ts states it in full): unpinning refuses only the NEXT handshake; an
// open relay socket keeps its shell until it drops on its own. And why a REGISTRY of killers: the
// sessions a key can hold live in three unrelated places — the standing phone host's pool
// (standing-host.ts), the interactive phone host's single session (host-service.ts
// `initRemoteHost`) and the desktop relay host's `live` set (relay-host.ts). A revoke that knows
// only one of them (the old `onRevoke: killRelayHostsByPeerKey`) leaves the other two serving.
// Each host registers its killer when it is wired; `killPeerSessionsByKey` runs them all.
