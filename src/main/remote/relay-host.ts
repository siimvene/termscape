// The JOIN POINT on the host (docs/remote-sessions.md 4c): once two humans have mutually approved
// each other, the bridged peer becomes a FIRST-CLASS CorePlatform client of this desktop's core.
//
// There is very little code here on purpose. 4b already made `electronPlatform` multi-client (a
// client is a webContents OR a UiSink in the peer registry), and Stages 1-3 wrote presence, the
// canvas reflector and terminal co-attach against CorePlatform. So the whole of "a remote desktop
// opens as a project tab" reduces to: mint one ClientId, register one sink, join presence, and route
// the encrypted tunnel into `platform.dispatch` / `platform.cast`. Everything else just works
// (src/main/peer-integration.test.ts proved it against a fake sink; this module supplies the socket).
//
// It is the electron-side twin of `src/server/ws.ts`, and it deliberately mirrors that file's shape:
// attach the sink, join the hub, req → dispatch → respond, cast → cast, and on close run the ONE
// teardown (leave → dropClient → prune). Divergence between the two remote surfaces is a bug.
//
// SECURITY — nothing is served before MUTUAL approval. The peer is registered (and therefore able to
// reach any channel the shell registered on the platform) only from the trust gate's `onOpen`, i.e.
// after BOTH humans compared the same SAS and pressed Confirm. The E2EE handshake completing
// (`onReady`) proves only that SOMEONE holds the pairing token — a pre-approval request is answered
// with E_UNAUTHORIZED and never touches a handler. A pairing grants shell access; the SAS is the
// only thing between a relay MITM and that shell.
//
// SCOPE: this is the DESKTOP-peer vocabulary (the invited peer is fully trusted, as the invite copy
// states). The standing PHONE host keeps its existing legacy vocabulary in `host-service.ts` — with
// its deny-by-default fs jail — and is deliberately NOT routed through this dispatch path.
