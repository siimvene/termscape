/**
 * Remember the main window's size, position and maximized state across launches.
 *
 * The window was created at a hard-coded 1400x900 on every launch, so a user who works maximized
 * re-maximized it every single time. Electron persists nothing on its own — there is no platform
 * that does this for us (macOS's NSWindow frame autosave is not wired up by Electron either), so
 * it is ours to store.
 *
 * Everything here is Electron-free on purpose, in the same shape as `keydown-intercept.ts`: the
 * decisions are pure functions over plain rectangles and the glue takes a structural window, so the
 * refusals below can be pressed by a test instead of only by a person with two monitors. The one
 * `electron` call this feature needs — `screen.getAllDisplays()` — is made at the call site in
 * `index.ts` and passed in as work areas.
 *
 * DESKTOP ONLY, and genuinely so: the Server Edition renders into a browser tab whose geometry is
 * the browser's business, and the mobile companion has no window concept. Nothing here belongs in
 * `src/core`.

 *   choice, and on some window managers it is not the restored rectangle at all.
 * - **Fullscreen.** `isMaximized()` is FALSE while a macOS window is fullscreen, so capturing here
 *   would record `maximized: false` and quietly forget that the user works maximized — the exact
 *   complaint this feature exists to answer. Skipping keeps the last non-fullscreen state, which
 *   also means the app never reopens into fullscreen; that is deliberate, not an oversight. A
 *   fullscreen window is usually a temporary mode, and restoring one is much harder to escape from
 *   on first launch than restoring a maximized one.
 *
 * In both cases the previously saved record stands, which is the honest outcome: "we could not
 * observe a new preference", never "the preference is gone".
 *
 * While MAXIMIZED the bounds come from `getNormalBounds()`, never `getBounds()`: the latter returns
 * the maximized rectangle, so saving it would make the next un-maximize restore to a window the
 * size of the screen — the state would look right and behave wrong, and only for the users who
 * maximize.
 *
 * While un-maximized it is `getBounds()`, and the two are the same rectangle wherever both work.
 * The split exists for Linux, where Electron documents `getNormalBounds()` as supported only on
 * some desktop environments; `getBounds()` has no such caveat, so the common case stops depending
 * on the window manager. The maximized case still does, and cannot be helped from here — but it
 * also matters less, because that record restores by re-maximizing rather than by its size.
