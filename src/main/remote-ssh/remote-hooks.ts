   * Materialise this instance's per-node tokens ON THE HOST — `<home>/.nodeterm/node-tokens/<id>`,

   * `NODETERM_NODE_TOKEN_DIR` and the managed script already reads (`head -n 1 "$DIR/$NODE_ID"`).
   * Nothing wrote it before this, which is why every remote node was permanently `legacy`.
   *
   * THE INVARIANT — a credential NEVER rides an ssh command line. The host's process table is
   * readable by its OTHER users (`ps` shows full argv), and a remote command line is argv on both
   * ends. So the token goes on STDIN, as the endpoint-file write above already does, and only the
   * (non-secret) path is interpolated. Do not "simplify" this into `printf %s <token> > file`.
   *
   * Fail-open per node AND overall. A connect that died over an identity file would be a far worse
   * regression than an unverified remote node: a node with no token file presents an empty header,
   * which the server reads as `legacy` — the designed state, not an outage.
   *
   * `mint` returning '' is a REFUSAL (no secret, or the case-fold collision guard), and a refusal
   * SWEEPS: an earlier connect's file for that id is precisely the token its colliding twin would
   * read, so leaving it in place is the attack the local `node-token-service` sweeps for.
   *
   * Fail-open does NOT mean fail-silent: a node whose write did not land has no token to present,
   * and the trust-on-first-proof latch lives at the DESKTOP and is keyed by node id, so leaving it
   * armed over a token that is not there is a permanent 403 (invariant 7). Every failure path here
   * therefore calls `hookServer.forgetProvenNode`.
   *
   * KNOWN LIMITATION — the dir is flat, i.e. per HOST ACCOUNT, not per nodeterm instance. Two
   * instances driving the same host+user (two desktops sharing a deploy account, or a desktop
   * whose SSH project points at a host that also runs a headless Server Edition under the same
   * $HOME) mint with DIFFERENT secrets and overwrite each other's files. The loser's sessions then
   * present a token carrying the winner's kid, which `verifyNodeToken` reads as `legacy` — never as
   * another node, and never as `forged`. So the cost is a silent drop to the fail-open state, not a
   * mis-verification. Scoping the dir as `node-tokens/<kid>/<id>` would close it and needs NO client
   * change (the client uses whatever dir the endpoint file names) — it is left out here only to keep
   * the remote layout identical to the local one; see the task A11 report.
