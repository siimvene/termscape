// The shim scripts copied onto an SSH host must stay MACHINE-NEUTRAL: no path that only means
// something on the desktop/server that generated them.
//
// Since the local shims gained the shared-Codex identity prelude, the two builders take an
// `identityRoot` — this machine's `<userDataDir>/codex-thread-nodes`. The LOCAL installers pass it;
// the SSH installer must not, because a record root under one machine's user-data dir is not a
// path on somebody else's server. The rule is stated in three places (CLAUDE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md,
// docs/shared-codex-node-identity.md) and was enforced by none of them.
//
// WHY IT NEEDS A GUARD RATHER THAN A REVIEWER: the failure is SILENT AND ONE-SIDED. A remote shim
// carrying the prelude still works — the outer `[ -n "$CODEX_THREAD_ID" ]` guard is false in a
// remote pane, and even if it were true the baked root does not exist there, so every candidate
// read fails and the block changes nothing. Nothing breaks, no test goes red, no user reports a
// bug. The only symptom is that this machine's user-data layout is now sitting in a file on
// someone else's server, written there by us, and refreshed on every connect.
//
// Two legs, because they catch the mistake at different moments:
//   1. the VALUE — the neutral exports the SSH installer writes carry nothing machine-specific;
//   2. the IMPORT — `remote-hooks.ts` cannot even reach a builder that would produce one.
// Leg 2 is the one that survives a refactor: a future author who reaches for the parameterised
// builder "so the remote shim gets the fix too" is stopped at the import, before there is a value
// to assert about.
//
// Every assertion has a POSITIVE CONTROL beside it. A guard whose subject has been renamed or
// removed matches nothing and reports clean — the same failure mode `fs-atomic.guard.test.ts`
// opens with — and a silent pass here would restore exactly the blindness this file exists to end.
