// An ssh-agent owned by THIS app run, so an unlocked key is forgotten when nodeterm quits.
//
// `AddKeysToAgent=yes` (control-master.ts) makes the first successful unlock load the key into
// whatever `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` names, and every later master then authenticates with no prompt at all.
// Pointed at the user's LOGIN agent that unlock outlives the app entirely: the key stays usable by
// every process on the machine until logout or reboot, which makes the passphrase on the key file
// nearly decorative once it has been typed. Pointing the masters at an agent this app spawns and
// kills scopes the unlock to the app's lifetime instead: quit nodeterm and the next launch asks
// again, while a single run keeps its single prompt (reconnects, watchdog respawns, closing and
// reopening a project all reuse it).
//
// What this does and does not buy, precisely: it scopes the key's LIFETIME, not its reachability.
// The socket is 0600, but any process running as this user can still point `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` at it
// and use the key while the app is up, exactly as with the login agent.
//
// Deliberate tradeoffs:
//  - A key ALREADY loaded in the user's login agent no longer authenticates a nodeterm master, so
//    those users now see one prompt per app run where they previously saw none. That is the price
//    of "forgotten on quit"; `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` names exactly one socket, so there is no both.
//  - Nothing is ever added to the user's own agent, and their shell/git never see ours.
//  - A credential that lives ONLY in an agent (1Password, Secretive, a smartcard) has no key file
//    to unlock, so overriding the socket would lock those users out. Most are unaffected because
//    `IdentityAgent` in ~/.ssh/config overrides `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` and is the documented setup for
//    them; ssh-project.ts surfaces an error hint naming IdentityAgent for the rest (a hint, not
//    a retry - see connectOnce's failure tail for why retrying on the ambient agent is wrong).
//    CAVEAT (issue #427): the ENV-REFERENCE spellings — `IdentityAgent SSH_AUTH_SOCK` and
//    friends — resolve through the very variable this file overrides, so "config overrides env"
//    is false for exactly those users. They are honored anyway: an `ssh -G` probe
//    (core/remote-ssh/agent-probe.ts) detects them per host and the argv builders pin the
//    ambient socket with `-o IdentityAgent=…`, which beats both the config line and this
//    override. This env override itself stays unconditional — read that file before touching it.
//
// The agent runs in the FOREGROUND (`-D`) as a direct child, so `kill()` really ends it (the
// default double-forks away and would survive us), and with a default identity lifetime (`-t`)
// because `stop()` is not guaranteed to run: `app.exit()`, a SIGKILL or a crash leaves the agent
// reparented to init, holding the key, with its socket unlinked by the next run's `start()` — an
// unreachable process that lives until reboot. The lifetime is what bounds that case.
