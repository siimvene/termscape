/**
 * The main window's `before-input-event` decision as ONE pure function — the desktop half of the
 * pair whose renderer half is `src/renderer/lib/zoomShortcut.ts` (same shape: a key-state-only
 * input, an action-or-null out, and the refusals as the point of the module).
 *
 * **Why the main process gets a say at all.** A menu accelerator is handled *before* the page sees
 * the key, so a renderer-side listener for one would simply never run on the desktop.
 * `before-input-event`'s `preventDefault` suppresses the menu item AND the page event, which is why
 * each claimed chord has to forward its intent to the renderer over IPC itself rather than letting
 * the key through. The three chords, and who claims them TODAY:
 *
 *   ⌘M → Window ▸ Minimize — a live accelerator on **every** platform (`{role:'minimize'}`).
 *   ⌘W → Window ▸ Close — a live accelerator on **Windows/Linux only**; the mac template has no
 *         `{role:'close'}`, so on macOS this module is now ⌘W's only handler.
 *   ⌘0 → not in any menu at all any more; this module is its only handler, which is exactly why
 *         the View menu's Fit View item deliberately carries NO accelerator.
 *
 * (This paragraph used to say "we never call `Menu.setApplicationMenu`, so Electron installs its
 * DEFAULT menu". That has been false since `buildAppMenu` landed in `index.ts`. The menu is OURS
 * now, so the list above is a fact about `buildAppMenu` — check it there, not against Electron's
 * defaults, and update this comment when you edit that template.)
 *
 * **Why it is pure and lives here rather than in the callback.** Deleting a branch from an inline
 * callback breaks nothing and throws nothing — the shortcut just quietly starts minimizing the
 * window / closing it / resetting the WINDOW's page zoom instead of doing the app's thing. Worse,
 * a modifier test here is what keeps a branch off ordinary typing, so loosening one silently makes
 * this window swallow **bare** keystrokes app-wide, and `index.ts` merges that kind of edit without
 * a conflict. Both failures are invisible to a test that reads the source; they are one assertion
 * each against this function.
 *
 * **This module stays the closed list of main-intercepted chords.** ⌘M and ⌘W are now resolved
 * from the keybinding registry (`node.toggleMarkdown` / `node.close`), so the USER decides which
 * chord they are — but nothing else is intercepted here, because everything else reaches the
 * renderer's dispatcher on its own. The **remappable** half of that list is ALSO written down in
 * `shared/keybindings.ts` as `MAIN_INTERCEPTED_COMMAND_IDS` (the Settings UI's app-wide shadow
 * warning reads it, and cannot derive it from here — main is not importable from the renderer);
 * a third REGISTRY-BACKED intercept added here owes that list an entry, which
 * `keydown-intercept.test.ts` pins. Note what that pin does NOT cover: a hardcoded ⌘0-shaped
 * intercept has no command id, so it cannot appear in the list and the invariant test cannot see
 * it — it would swallow its chord app-wide with the Settings recorder reporting no conflict. If
 * you add one, the Settings UI needs a separate way to know about it.
 *
 * Desktop-only by construction (it exists to fight a native menu), so it stays in `src/main` next
 * to `main-window.ts` rather than moving to `src/core` — the Server Edition's browser shell has no
 * application menu to steal a chord back from.

/**
 * PURE. Which menu items must be disabled while the intercepts are stood down.

 * **Why the stand-down needs a menu leg at all.** `preventDefault` is the only lever this module
 * has, and NOT calling it hands the key to the page *and*, if the page ignores it, to the menu —
 * whose accelerators are handled above the page either way. So a stand-down that stopped at the
 * intercept would deliver ⌘0 and (on macOS) ⌘W to the terminal, and hand ⌘M to
 * `{role:'minimize'}` and, on Windows/Linux, Ctrl+W to `{role:'close'}`. For a terminal-first user
 * that is strictly WORSE than not having the policy: Ctrl+W is readline's kill-word, and a Linux
 * user pressing it would close their window. Disabling the item suppresses its accelerator, so the
 * chord falls through to the page → the renderer's dispatcher (terminal context, terminal-first:
 * nothing matches) → xterm → the PTY. That is what completes "under terminal-first everything
 * reaches the shell", ⌘M included.
 *
 * **The list serves BOTH stand-downs** — the policy one above and an armed shortcut recorder
 * (`menuStandsDown` composes them; `syncMenuForStandDown` disables these items for either). The
 * earlier argument here was that a recorder greying out Minimize was a worse trade than an
 * unrecordable ⌘M; that trade REVERSED once the menu leg existed for the policy anyway. The cost is
 * now a momentary grey-out while a modal recorder is armed — self-healing the instant it disarms —
 * and the benefit is that four chords now REACH the recorder instead of acting on the app: ⌘M
 * everywhere, off-mac Ctrl+W, and ⌘⇧B / ⌘, which did not merely fail to record but FIRED —
 * pressing ⌘⇧B into the recorder opened the kanban board behind the Settings dialog, and ⌘,
 * re-opened Settings. **Reaching the recorder is all this buys, and it is the unconditional part.**
 * Whether the chord can then be BOUND is a separate question, answered by the pre-save gates in
 * `ShortcutsSection.commitCandidate`: while its owning command still holds it, it is refused there
 * like any other taken chord — the user has to Disable or remap that command first.
 *
 * **KNOWN GAP for the recording half, pre-existing and accepted.** This list was written for the
 * POLICY stand-down, so it covers only the command-style items that policy needed. The always-on
 * app roles — `{role:'quit'}` (⌘Q), `{role:'hide'}`/`hideOthers`, `toggleDevTools`,
 * `togglefullscreen` — are NOT here, so those chords still ACT while a recorder is armed (⌘Q quits
 * the app). Adding them is refused rather than overlooked: ONE list drives both stand-downs, so
 * they would also go dead for a terminal-first user with a terminal focused, and quit/hide must
 * never be policy-gated. Closing it properly means splitting the list per stand-down.
 *
 * mac carries no CLOSE id: the mac template has no `{role:'close'}` at all (Window ▸ Minimize /
 * Zoom / Front), which is exactly why `keydownIntercept` is ⌘W's only handler there. Kanban and
 * Settings are on BOTH platforms — one `viewSubmenu` array and one `settingsItem` object are shared
 * by the two templates — so they are suspended on both.
 *
 * **What suspending kanban/settings actually buys, since neither is an intercepted chord.** ⌘⇧B and
 * ⌘, are ordinary REGISTRY commands (`view.kanbanToggle` / `app.settings`); the renderer's
 * dispatcher would resolve them if it ever saw the keydown, but under app-first the MENU takes them
 * above the page and the dispatcher never runs. Disabling the items removes that theft, so under
 * terminal-first with a terminal focused the chord reaches the page → the resolver, which REFUSES
 * it (a terminal context under terminal-first matches only commands flagged `allowInTerminal`, and
 * that flag is app-first-only) → xterm → the PTY. Without these two ids, terminal-first would
 * deliver every chord to the shell EXCEPT the two the menu happened to own, which is the same
 * inconsistency the minimize/close leg exists to remove.
 *
 * **RELOAD (⌘R / ⌘⇧R) is deliberately NOT here — named exception, do not "complete" the list.**
 * `{role:'reload'}` / `{role:'forceReload'}` are the app's crash-recovery lever: a renderer wedged
 * badly enough to stop dispatching keys is exactly when the user needs them, and a policy that
 * suspended them would take the lever away precisely in the state that calls for it. The recovery
 * also depends on the reload actually happening in MAIN — a main-frame navigation is one of the
 * three sites that reset `terminalFocused`/`shortcutRecording` (see `navigationClearsRecording`),
 * so suspending reload would strand the very bits a stuck page leaves set. The cost is honest and
 * small: a terminal-first user's ⌘R reloads the window instead of reaching the shell.

 *
 * `getBindings` is read per event rather than captured: settings change while the window lives, and
 * it returns a cached object (`index.ts` recomputes it on `settingsStore.onChange`, not here — a
 * sanitize per keystroke would be real work on the input path).
 *
 * `isRecording` is the same shape and for the same reason — the renderer flips it over IPC while
 * this window is alive. **It is checked BEFORE `preventDefault`, not before the send**: a chord
 * THIS MODULE claims never reaches the page at all, so while the Settings shortcut recorder is
 * armed, leaving the key completely alone is the only way the recorder can see it. Swallowing but
 * not forwarding would still hand the recorder nothing — and forwarding is the live bug, since ⌘W
 * pressed into the recorder deletes the canvas's selected nodes.
 *
 * **What this stand-down buys on its own, and what the MENU leg adds.** This half only stops US
 * from taking the key; it has no say over the application MENU, whose accelerators are handled
 * above the page either way — so by itself it delivers **⌘0** everywhere and **⌘W on macOS**
 * (neither is in the menu) and nothing else. **The menu now follows recording too**:
 * `index.ts`'s `syncMenuForStandDown` asks `menuStandsDown(recording, policy, terminalFocused)`
 * and disables every item in `menuItemIdsToSuspend` while a recorder is armed, so the suspended
 * items' chords — **⌘M** (`{role:'minimize'}`, every platform), **⌘⇧B** and **⌘,** (View ▸ Toggle
 * Kanban Board and Settings, every platform) and **Ctrl+W** on Windows/Linux — reach the recorder
 * instead of minimizing the window, opening the board or opening Settings. **RELOAD (⌘R / ⌘⇧R)
 * stays unrecordable by design**: it is the app's crash-recovery lever and is deliberately absent
 * from that list (see `menuItemIdsToSuspend`).
 *
 * `isStoodDown` is the SECOND suspension and the same shape again, but a different fact:
 * `policyStandsDown(policy, terminalFocused)` — the user chose `terminal-first` AND an xterm
 * currently holds keyboard focus in the renderer. It is a separate parameter rather than an `||`
 * folded into `isRecording` because the two suspend for unrelated reasons on unrelated schedules
 * (a Settings dialog being armed vs. a live focus mirror), and one boolean would make "the
 * recorder still works for an app-first user" — the overwhelmingly common case — impossible to
 * assert. Both are checked BEFORE `preventDefault` for the same reason: a claimed chord never
 * reaches the page at all, and the page is exactly who terminal-first stands down FOR.
 *
 * **The menu leg is SHARED by the two suspensions, on the same item list.** `index.ts`'s
 * `syncMenuForStandDown` disables every item in `menuItemIdsToSuspend` below —
 * `{role:'minimize'}`, Toggle Kanban Board and Settings on all platforms, plus off-mac
 * `{role:'close'}`, with RELOAD deliberately left out — for exactly as long as
 * `menuStandsDown(recording, policy, terminalFocused)` is true. The policy half has to have it:
 * not calling `preventDefault` hands the key to the page and, failing that, to the menu, so
 * without the menu leg a terminal-first user's ⌘M would minimize the window and their Ctrl+W —
 * readline's kill-word — would CLOSE it on Windows/Linux, which is strictly worse than not having
 * the policy. With the items disabled the chord completes the trip it was promised: page → the
 * renderer's dispatcher (terminal context, terminal-first, nothing matches) → xterm → the PTY.
 * The recording half rides the same list for a different destination: page → the armed recorder.
 * That the ITEM list is shared does not merge the two INTERCEPT thunks — they stay independent
 * parameters below, and only the menu's single `enabled` boolean composes them.
 *
 * **The stand-down leg cannot be more reliable than the mirror behind it**, and the mirror is a
 * renderer reporting over fire-and-forget IPC. Every uncertainty therefore resolves to NOT stood
 * down (intercepts on = the pre-feature app): `index.ts` starts `terminalFocused` false and every
 * way the page can stop existing resets it there. Getting that direction backwards would leave ⌘W
 * and ⌘M with the application MENU — closing and minimizing the window — with no live component
