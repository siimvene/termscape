// The desktop shell's half of the context meter's mount-time rehydration (issue #813).
//
// `core/context-ensure.test.ts` pins the ROUTING with injected deps. What it cannot reach is this
// shell's `ensureRemote` closure, which is inline in `index.ts` over `ptyManager`,
// `sshProjectManager` and `remoteContextTail` — so its three load-bearing properties are pinned at
// source level, the same way `remote-end-wiring.test.ts` and `codex-identity-record-wiring.test.ts`
// pin theirs. Each of them fails SILENTLY if it regresses: a missing jail reads a file the host
// named, a fall-through meters the wrong machine, and a handler nobody registers simply leaves the
// meter blank exactly as before.
