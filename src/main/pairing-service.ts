// Phone-pairing service (main process) — the host side of the nodeterm iOS "scan a QR" flow.
//
// start() mints a one-time token, opens a single-shot LAN HTTP listener on a random port, and
// returns the JSON payload (for the renderer to render as a QR) plus whether SSH looks reachable.
// The phone scans the QR, generates an Ed25519 keypair on-device, and POSTs {token, publicKey}
// to http://<host>:<pairPort>/pair. On a token match we append the key to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
// and stop the listener. The private key never leaves the phone; the only secret in the QR is the
// single-use token.
//
// Windows is relay-only: no key is installed (see `directSsh` in createPairingService), the QR
// says `"ssh":false`, and a pairing whose relay mint fails pairs nothing.
//
// Pure bits (payload build, key validation, LAN-IPv4 pick) live in `pairing-core.ts` so they're
// unit-tested without spinning up a server.
