/**
 * The desktop's agent-messaging service — the ONE caller of `deliverAgentMessage` (PR #207).
 *
 * Canvas.tsx's dispatch for `send`/`reply` is deliberately thin: it validates the arguments,
 * checks the SOURCE is a control-capable agent, and forwards `{verb, sourceNodeId, targetNodeId,
 * body}` here over IPC. Everything that decides whether and how the message lands runs in THIS
 * process, against main's own stores — the scope resolution, the per-project switch, flow control,
 * the pane probes, the envelope, the receipt, the trace — so nothing that ends up inside the
 * envelope or inside an authorization decision is renderer-supplied beyond the two node ids and
 * the body. `agent-messaging.test.ts` runs the whole service; `agent-message.test.ts` and
 * `agent-message.realtty.test.ts` pin the primitive underneath it.
 *
 * ── THREE SURFACES ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * - **Desktop (Electron):** wired in `src/main/index.ts` — the only surface with the verbs.
 * - **Server Edition:** never wired; `/control/send` answers `control-unsupported-on-this-edition`
 *   (`src/server/control-unsupported.ts`) for a verified caller and the messaging refusal for an
 *   unverified one. Everything this file imports from `src/core` still ships on both shells.
 * - **Mobile (phone):** never a sender (it drives canvas control over relay→IPC, not `/control/*`);
 *   a phone-spawned node is a valid TARGET and resolves like any other store node.
