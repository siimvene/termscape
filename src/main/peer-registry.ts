// The desktop's PEER sink registry (docs/remote-sessions.md 4b).
//
// A relay peer (a phone, or another desktop — wired in 4c) is a FIRST-CLASS CorePlatform client of
// this desktop's core, addressed by a UiSink instead of a webContents. Everything Stages 1-3 built
// (presence hub, canvas reflector, terminal co-attach) is already written against CorePlatform and
// is multi-client; the ONLY thing that made a peer half-joined — the host saw the phone in its
// facepile, the phone saw nothing — is that `electronPlatform.sendTo` resolved ids through
// `webContents.fromId` and `clientIds()` returned the main window alone, so every `sendTo`/
// `broadcast` aimed at a peer silently no-op'd. This module is that missing seam: it owns the peer
// sinks (and their WS backpressure, via the shared UiSinkRegistry), and platform-electron reads it
// to route sendTo / broadcast / clientIds.
//
// Ids are minted by the CALLER via allocateRelayClientId() (≥ 1_000_000), so a peer id can never
// collide with a webContents id (those start small and count up).
//
// Cost to a solo desktop user: zero. With no peer registered the registry holds an empty Map, arms
// no timer, and every lookup is a miss — the webContents path is bit-identical to before.

 *   2. onPeerGone → PtyManager.dropClient — nothing else tells the pty layer this subscriber is
 *      gone (a vanished peer sends no `pty:kill`): the pty is never released, its detach-time
 *      scrollback snapshot never taken, and a pause it owed could never be returned — with
 *      co-attach that freezes the shared terminal for EVERY viewer.
 *   3. registry.unregister — drops the sink and prunes only this id's paused/desynced entries,
 *      stopping the drain sweep if it was the last one (== ServerPlatform.detach).
 * A missed step is a ghost peer, a leaked pty client, or a timer that outlives its peer.
