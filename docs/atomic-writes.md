# Atomic writes

**The honest limit first: `renameAtomic` does not make a write reliable. It makes a write that
would have been lost to a passing antivirus scan land instead.** A disk that is full, a directory
that is read-only, or a file some process holds open indefinitely will still fail — loudly, which
is the point. Nothing here protects against a machine losing power between two saves.

Implementation: [`src/core/fs-atomic.ts`](../src/core/fs-atomic.ts). Tests:
`src/core/fs-atomic.test.ts` (behaviour) and `src/core/fs-atomic.guard.test.ts` (the scan that
keeps every store on the helper).

## What every store does

A store that persists JSON writes a temp file first and renames it over the target, so a reader
sees either the old bytes or the new ones and never a half-written file:

```ts
await fs.writeFile(tmp, JSON.stringify(store), { mode: 0o600 })
await renameAtomic(tmp, target)
```

That is correct on POSIX, where `rename(2)` is atomic and replaces the destination
unconditionally.

## Why the plain version loses data on Windows

`MoveFileEx` fails with a sharing violation — Node reports it as **`EPERM`**, sometimes `EACCES` or
`EBUSY` — whenever the **destination** is open by anyone at that instant. Not held open for long:
opened. The things that open a file the moment you finish writing it are not exotic:

| What | Why it has the file open |
|---|---|
| Windows Defender real-time scanning | scans each newly written file |
| Windows Search indexer | indexes it |
| OneDrive / a backup client | a user profile is usually synced |
| Our own concurrent writers | two saves racing one destination |

So on Windows a routine save could throw and the data was simply lost — intermittently,
unreproducibly, and **more often on the machines that are best protected**. The stores affected
are not peripheral: the user's canvas layout, their settings, their sealed credentials and their
pinned remote devices.

Twenty-odd files did this, across three spellings — `fs.rename`, `renameSync`, and a `rename`
destructured from `node:fs/promises`. Every one of them reads as a correct atomic write, because
on the platform most of this app was written on it *is* one. That is why the rule is enforced by a
scan test rather than by convention: a store added next year gets the retry because the test
refuses the alternative, not because its author read this page.

## What the helper does, and deliberately does not

**Retries the rename, briefly.** Five attempts over about 310 ms. Each attempt is still one
indivisible rename, so retrying cannot tear a write — it only tries the same operation again once
whoever held the destination has let go. Scanner windows are milliseconds, so the first retry
almost always wins; the tail exists for a sync client mid-upload.

**Does not serialize application decisions.** Unique temps and rename retry guarantee complete
bytes, not correct ordering between two snapshots loaded before either write. A shared store with
multiple read-modify-write callers still needs one mutation funnel (or an equivalent
revision/compare-and-swap protocol) of its own.

**Does not retry forever.** A genuinely locked file must fail. Several callers have contracts that
depend on a failed save being reported as one. A save that eventually lands is worth less than an
accurate answer about whether it did.

**Does not retry every error.** `ENOENT` means the temp file is gone, which is a caller bug;
retrying delays a clearer error and then reports the same thing. `ENOSPC` will not improve by
waiting.

**Does not branch on platform.** The retry is a no-op on POSIX, where these codes do not arise from
this operation. Branching would mean the behaviour under test on a developer's Mac was not the
behaviour shipped to a user on Windows.

**Never swallows the final failure.** The last error is rethrown with its original `code`.

## The second bug at the same sites

Independent of the platform question: a **fixed** temp name (always `<file>.tmp`) shared by
concurrent writers. One writer's rename then publishes the other's half-written bytes, or moves the
temp out from under it so the loser fails with a confusing `ENOENT`.

`writeFileAtomic` and `tempNameFor` generate a per-call unique name
(`<target>.<pid>.<seq>.<uuid>.tmp`). The UUID is the uniqueness guarantee. PID and sequence remain
because they make ownership cleanup and diagnostics possible, but they are not globally unique:
two containers can both be PID 1, worker isolates share a PID with independent module counters,
and an OS can reuse a PID while crash litter remains. `Date.now()` does **not** make a name unique
either — two bridge calls, shutdown flushes, or WS clients can enter a save inside one millisecond.
The guard deliberately rejects pid-plus-clock and pid-plus-counter names. Remote-shell writes use
the equivalent property with a locally minted random UUID; the remote host never has to
interpolate a nonce.

The same rule applies to SSH and scp staging even though those writes do not call `fs.writeFile`.
`remoteAtomicWrite` mints a bounded `.nodeterm-<uuid>.tmp` sibling before quoting both complete
remote paths, so spaces, apostrophes, literal POSIX backslashes and `~/` expansion keep their
meanings. The bounded leaf is independent of the target: appending `.uuid.tmp` to a valid
`NAME_MAX` filename would exceed the directory's component limit. It preserves the `cat`/`mv`
status while removing exactly that invocation's temp. Uploads likewise use UUID directories rather
than a timestamp plus a per-manager counter, and failed uploads remove only their own directory.
Downloads and media-cache fetches stage through hidden UUID `.part` paths beside the target; the
bounded name avoids lengthening an already maximum-length filename. Ordinary downloads also
reserve the final candidate with an exclusive lock, so two app processes cannot both observe
`report.pdf` as absent and overwrite each other after transferring. Candidate checks use `lstat`:
a dangling symlink is an occupied directory entry, not evidence that the name is free. Atomic
remote stdin sites use
the same helper for filesystem writes, tmux.conf, the credential-bearing hook endpoint and node
tokens, agent status, and pending answers. Generated hook scripts/config merges still have direct
writes and are not covered by this atomicity claim.

"Only one instance exists" and "the write queue serializes this" are true within one process and
silent about a second — and a second is not hypothetical: the Server Edition takes a `--data-dir`,
so two servers can be aimed at one directory and a desktop app can share it.

Atomicity is not the only thing a second process breaks. A per-process write queue serializes
that process's writers, but a read-modify-write applied to an in-memory cache the other process
has since overtaken is a *logical* lost update: the rename is whole, and it publishes a list from
which the other process's row is simply absent. `settings-store.ts` closes this with a
**cross-process advisory lock** held across the whole read + write (`withFileLock` on
`settings.json.lock`, `src/core/file-lock.ts`): the lock is the atomic existence of an `O_EXCL`
lockfile, so exactly one writer at a time — in ANY process that also takes it (both write paths
here do) — reads and renames, and no cooperating writer's change is lost. It is advisory: a writer
that does not take it (a raw external write) is still not serialized, so the same read re-checks
the file's inode/mtime/size stamp and, on detecting such a landed write, re-runs the mutation
against it (bounded).

Two things it will **never** do. It never persists a **stale** result: if the base kept changing
under a hot non-cooperating writer past the retry budget, or the lock could not be acquired in
time, the write is abandoned with a throw (`SettingsWriteConflictError` / `FileLockTimeoutError`),
because several callers treat a failed save as `persisted:false` and a save that lands on a base it
never saw is worse than one that honestly failed (it is the contract `codex-accounts:add`'s
rollback depends on). And it never publishes **defaults over a corrupt file**: a settings.json that
EXISTS but does not parse may be a recoverable hand-edit, so a mutate/save throws
`SettingsCorruptError` rather than "repairing" it to defaults (which orphaned every account dir it
stopped listing). A genuinely MISSING or empty file is different — it carries nothing to lose and
writes the defaults base. The residual is only the historical crash-recovery race (two processes
breaking the same stale lockfile in the same instant), narrowed by a re-stat before the break and
no worse than the lock-less check-then-act it replaced.

## Known limitations (tracked for a follow-up)

Single-process account mutation is fully covered — one desktop app, or one server with any number
of browser tabs, all serialize through the FIFO save chain and lose no row. What is NOT yet
guaranteed is concurrent MUTATION across multiple processes sharing one `--data-dir`. Two honest
gaps remain, both deferred to a dedicated follow-up branch (do not describe them as fixed):

- **Cross-process add/add can still, rarely, lose a row.** The cross-process serialization rests on
  the hand-rolled O_EXCL lock in `src/core/file-lock.ts`, which can double-acquire when two
  processes break the same STALE lockfile in the same instant. The lock is now BOUNDED — an
  unremovable or unreadable lock throws `FileLockTimeoutError` rather than hanging or busy-spinning
  — but it is not exclusive under a simultaneous stale-break. The complete fix is a vetted
  cross-process lock (e.g. `proper-lockfile`) with owner tokens, not part of this round.
- **Remote account teardown is not guaranteed across stale per-process caches.** The account
  handlers (`claude-accounts-service.ts` / `codex-accounts-service.ts`) read membership from THIS
  process's cache, not from disk under the lock. So a process with a stale cache can delete another
  process's remote row without its SSH teardown; a remote add's rollback ignores a failed teardown;
  and a disconnect mid-add can persist a remote account as local. The fix (read membership from disk
  under the lock inside those handlers) is deferred to the same follow-up.

**A unique name owes cleanup.** A fixed name self-healed — the next save simply overwrote the
litter. A unique one does not, so every caller must remove its own temp on failure.
`writeFileAtomic` does that for you; a site that builds its own write sequence must do it by hand.

Cleanup must not reverse the fix. A different pid only means "another process", not "a dead
process": desktop multi-instance mode and two `nodeterm-server --data-dir X` processes can share a
directory intentionally, including across PID namespaces where signal-0/`ESRCH` proves nothing.
`sweepStaleTempFiles` therefore never auto-deletes any pid-bearing temp; only the exact historical
ownerless `<file>.tmp` shape can be swept, after a conservative 24-hour grace.

## Deletes whose purpose is to stop something

`removeAtomic` retries the same transient Windows codes for `unlink`, and treats only `ENOENT` as
"gone". The trap it closes is reporting, not retrying: such a delete is normally written as an
unlink wrapped in a bare catch commented "already absent", which is correct for the failure the
author had in mind and wrong for every other one — `EPERM` means the file is still sitting there.
`clearAtomicTarget` extends that contract for credential clears: it reports incomplete while any
recognized temp remains or the directory cannot be inspected, instead of telling the UI a
credential is gone while its bearer bytes remain next door.

## The rule, and how it is enforced

> No store publishes a file with a bare `fs.rename`. Use `renameAtomic`, or `writeFileAtomic` if
> the whole temp-write-publish cycle is what you want.

`src/core/fs-atomic.guard.test.ts` scans `src/core`, `src/main` and `src/server`, and fails on any
bare rename in all three spellings. The only exemption is `core/fs-atomic.ts` itself. It flags a
bare `rename`/`renameSync` only when the file actually imported that name from `fs` — several
stores have a `rename()` method of their own, and a guard that cries wolf is a guard somebody
deletes.

The temp-name half checks the PROPERTY, not the helper: an inline `randomUUID()` path is also
correct. The guard strips comments before matching, so a file may still *discuss* `fs.rename` in
prose. It also asserts it found a source tree at all — a scan that matches nothing otherwise
reports clean, which is the same class of silent failure as the bug.

## Surfaces

| Surface | Status |
|---|---|
| **Desktop** (Electron) | Covered. Windows is the platform this exists for; on macOS/Linux the retry is inert and behaviour is unchanged. |
| **Server Edition** | Covered for core stores — the helper is in `src/core`, so both shells get it. Its usual host is Linux, where the retry is inert, but a Windows-hosted server gets the same protection. The ControlMaster/scp manager is desktop-only. |
| **Mobile companion** | No client change. It holds no local stores of its own, but the agent-status mirror it reads from an SSH host now arrives through the unique remote temp path. The transport shape is unchanged. |
