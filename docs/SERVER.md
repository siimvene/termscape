# nodeterm Server Edition (Phase 2)

Run nodeterm's canvas in a browser, backed by a headless Node server on your own
machine or box. The server serves the **same** built renderer the desktop app uses
and speaks a WebSocket-RPC protocol to it; a browser-side `window.nodeTerminal`
shim (`src/renderer/bridge/`) stands in for the Electron preload, so the React UI is
unchanged. It boots the same Electron-free core services (`src/core/`) through a
`ServerPlatform`, so terminals get the same tmux session continuity as the desktop app.

> **Phase 2 scope: terminals only.** This is a real, usable terminal canvas over the
> network, but it is deliberately narrow — see [Limitations](#phase-2-limitations).

## Quickstart

```bash
npm run server:dev
```

`server:dev` runs `npm run build` (renderer + core) then `npm run server:build`
(bundles `src/server/main.ts` → `out/server/main.cjs` via esbuild) and finally
`node out/server/main.cjs`. On a repeat run where the renderer is already built you
can skip straight to `npm run server:start`.

### First run (setup token)

With no password configured yet, the server prints a **one-time setup URL** to stdout:

```
Setup: http://127.0.0.1:8443/setup?token=<32-hex>
nodeterm-server listening on http 127.0.0.1:8443
```

Open that URL, choose a password (min 8 chars), and you're signed in. The setup
token is single-use and lives only in memory (never written to disk), so it's
regenerated if the process restarts before setup completes.

### Headless setup (no interactive setup URL)

Seed the password out-of-band with an env var — useful for containers / CI where
nobody is watching stdout:

```bash
NODETERM_SERVER_PASSWORD='choose-a-strong-one' npm run server:start
```

When `NODETERM_SERVER_PASSWORD` is set **and** no password is configured yet, the
server writes the scrypt hash on boot and skips the setup URL entirely — go straight
to `/login`. It is ignored once a password already exists (it never overwrites).

### Manual build + run

```bash
npm run build         # electron-vite build → out/renderer, out/core
npm run server:build  # esbuild → out/server/main.cjs
npm run server:start  # node out/server/main.cjs
```

## Configuration

Precedence: **CLI flag > environment variable > default.**

| Flag | Env var | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--port <n>` | `NODETERM_PORT` | `8443` | TCP port to listen on. |
| `--host <h>` | `NODETERM_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Interface to bind. |
| `--data-dir <path>` | `NODETERM_DATA_DIR` | `~/.nodeterm-server` | Where auth, sessions, workspace, settings, and scrollback live. |
| `--renderer-dir <path>` | `NODETERM_RENDERER_DIR` | `out/renderer` (resolved from cwd) | Directory of the built renderer (`index.html` + hashed assets). |
| `--insecure-http` | — | off | Acknowledge serving plain HTTP directly on a non-loopback interface (see below). |
| — | `NODETERM_SERVER_PASSWORD` | — | Seed the password headlessly on first boot (see above). |
| `--trust-proxy-header <name>` | `NODETERM_TRUST_PROXY_HEADER` | — (off) | Reverse-proxy SSO trust: identity header asserted by your proxy (see [Reverse-proxy SSO](#reverse-proxy-sso-header-trust)). |
| `--trust-proxy-nets <list>` | `NODETERM_TRUST_PROXY_NETS` | `127.0.0.0/8, ::1/128` | Comma-separated IPs/CIDRs (IPv4+IPv6) whose requests may use the trust header. Only meaningful with the header set. |

Binding a **non-loopback** host (anything other than `127.0.0.1` / `localhost` /
`::1`) **without** `--insecure-http` is refused at startup — plain HTTP on a public
interface would leak the session cookie. The intended deployment is loopback-bound
behind a TLS-terminating reverse proxy (see [TLS](#tls-reverse-proxy)).

## Headless notification host

The Server Edition doubles as a **headless notification host**: a background process on any
Linux box that gives a phone SSHing into it full push / Live-Activity coverage — **without
serving the browser UI and without opening a single port**.

### One-line install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eneskirca/nodeterm/main/scripts/install-server.sh | bash
```

The installer (`scripts/install-server.sh`) is idempotent — re-run it any time to update. It:

- needs only `git`, `curl` and `tar` on the host — **Node.js is no longer a prerequisite**: if a
  system Node ≥ 20 (with npm) is present it's used as-is, otherwise the installer downloads a
  pinned Node LTS from nodejs.org into `~/.nodeterm-server-app/runtime/node` and uses it for the
  build and the systemd service (nothing is installed system-wide; Alpine/musl hosts still need a
  distro `nodejs`). It also warns (with the apt/dnf one-liner) if the C toolchain
  (`make`/`gcc`/`python3`) node-pty's native build needs is missing;
- clones (or `git pull`s) the repo into `~/.nodeterm-server-app`;
- installs deps (`npm ci --ignore-scripts`, then `npm rebuild node-pty` against Node's ABI —
  the same trap the [Docker](#docker--dokploy) build documents) and builds the renderer +
  server bundle;
- installs a **systemd** service (`NODETERM_HEADLESS=1`, `Restart=on-failure`, journald logs):
  a system unit at `/etc/systemd/system/nodeterm-server.service` when run as root, or a
  per-user unit + `loginctl enable-linger` otherwise — then enables and (re)starts it;
- writes **`<data-dir>/install-meta.json`** (`{version, commit, installedAt}`, where `<data-dir>`
  defaults to `~/.nodeterm-server`). The server reads it at boot and surfaces it to a paired phone
  through the agent-status mirror's top-level `server` block, so a connection can show which version
  this install is on — the answer to "how does an installed Server Edition learn about updates?";
- installs a **daily auto-update timer** (unless you opt out — see below).

Follow the logs with `journalctl -u nodeterm-server -f` (add `--user` for a non-root install).

### Auto-update

The installer also installs a `nodeterm-server-update.service` (a `oneshot`) plus a
`nodeterm-server-update.timer` (`OnCalendar=daily`, `RandomizedDelaySec=3600`, `Persistent=true`),
with the **same root/user split** as the main service (a system unit under
`/etc/systemd/system/`, or a per-user unit under `~/.config/systemd/user/`). When it fires, the
service:

1. `git pull --ff-only` in `~/.nodeterm-server-app` — updating the checkout **including this
   updater script**, so the updater logic keeps itself current;
2. re-execs the freshly-pulled `scripts/install-server.sh`, which rebuilds and restarts the
   service. The installer is idempotent, so an already-current pull just no-ops through a harmless
   rebuild.

**Opt out:** run the installer with `NODETERM_NO_AUTOUPDATE=1` — it skips the timer, and (so a
re-run can turn auto-update off) **removes an existing** timer/service. The installer prints the
timer status (`systemctl list-timers`) in its summary so you can confirm the next run.

Check or trigger it manually:

```bash
systemctl list-timers nodeterm-server-update.timer      # add --user for a non-root install
systemctl start nodeterm-server-update.service          # run an update now
```

### Per-user installs (one per Unix user)

An install covers **only the Unix user it runs as** — its systemd unit, `~/.nodeterm-server-app`
checkout, and `~/.nodeterm-server` data dir are that user's. A box with several server users
(`root`, `customerservice`, …) needs **one install per user**; the phone offers this per
connection (it installs under whichever user its SSH session logs in as). Non-root installs rely on
`loginctl enable-linger <user>` (the installer runs it) so the user's systemd manager — and thus
both the service and the auto-update timer — keep running without an active login session.

### `NODETERM_HEADLESS`

Set `NODETERM_HEADLESS=1` (also accepts `true`, case-insensitive) to boot in headless mode.
Everything boots **exactly as usual** — the loopback hook server, the agent-status mirror, the
usage poll, the granted push senders (push-notify + Live-Activity), and the pending-approvals
sweep — **except** the public HTTP/WS listener, which is **never bound**. There is no renderer
serving and no auth surface. `NODETERM_HOST` / `NODETERM_PORT` are ignored (nothing binds), and
`platform.broadcast` is a no-op while no browser UI is attached.

### Security rationale: zero open ports

The whole point of this mode is that it adds **no network attack surface**:

- **No public listener at all.** The HTTP/WS server is never created, so there is no port to
  expose, no login page to brute-force, and no session cookie in flight.
- **The hook server stays loopback-only.** Agent CLIs POST their lifecycle hooks to
  `127.0.0.1` (a per-session bearer token, fail-open) — it never leaves the host.
- **Push is outbound-only.** Notifications reach the phone over **outbound HTTPS**, authorized
  by a signed, device-scoped **grant** the phone itself drops at
  `~/.nodeterm/push-grants/<deviceId>.grant` when it reaches the host over SSH. No inbound
  connection, no standing relay identity — a grant a phone never dropped simply means no push.

The phone's own SSH session into the host is the trust boundary; nodeterm adds nothing listening
beside it.

### Session budget (idle-session reaper)

tmux sessions deliberately outlive their clients (that is the continuity contract), so a host that
serves many SSH projects slowly accumulates **detached** agent sessions nobody will ever come back
to — a field report counted 95 sessions holding 34 GB of idle `claude` processes. Every
nodeterm-server (headless or serving) runs a **session budget** (`src/core/session-budget.ts`, the
tmux counterpart of the renderer's WebGL budget): every 10 minutes it sweeps the local
`node-terminal` **and** SSH-remote `nodeterm-rmt` sockets and reaps the **least-recently-active
detached** `nt-*` sessions when

- host **available memory** drops below a watermark (default 10% of RAM, floor 1 GB) — the
  primary, pressure-driven trigger; or
- the **detached session count** exceeds a cap (default 48) — the accumulation backstop.

**Attached sessions are never touched**, a grace window (default 6 h since last activity) protects
recent work, kills are re-verified against a fresh listing, and each sweep reaps at most a small
batch (default 8) so convergence is gradual. A reaped session is indistinguishable from a reboot
to its node: on next open it **cold-restores** (scrollback snapshot + `claude --resume`). Tuning /
kill switch via env: `NODETERM_SESSION_MIN_AVAILABLE_MB`, `NODETERM_SESSION_MAX_DETACHED`,
`NODETERM_SESSION_GRACE_HOURS`, `NODETERM_SESSION_REAP_BATCH`, `NODETERM_SESSION_REAP_DISABLED=1`.

### Session memory (the RAM pill + per-session panel)

The reaper's counterpart for a human: `startSessionMemoryService` (`src/core/session-memory-service.ts`)
is booted here too, beside the reaper in `src/server/index.ts`, and `window.nodeTerminal.sessionMemory`
has a **real** ws-bridge implementation (not a stub). So the browser gets the bottom-left RAM pill and
the per-session breakdown, and both describe **the machine the server is served from**: its
`/proc/meminfo`, its `node-terminal` / `nodeterm-rmt` tmux sockets, its process table. Full write-up:
`docs/session-memory.md`.

**An SSH project's scope answers `ok:false` — "could not measure" — and that is deliberate.** The
server has no ControlMaster, so it cannot read the other host; answering with its own sessions would
publish this machine's memory under that host's name. Same degrade as remote usage, one step
stricter:

- The service is given **`isRemoteProject` but no `run`**. Knowing which projects are somebody
  else's machine and being able to read them are different capabilities, and the option pair is
  asymmetric to say so (`run` optional, `isRemoteProject` required).
- The refusal is decided **by identity**, not by trusting the renderer's `remote` flag:
  `sshScopePredicate({ sshProjectIds: () => workspaceStore.sshProjectIds() })`. A query arriving
  without that flag — a client that has not learned the project is an SSH one yet — would otherwise
  fall through to the LOCAL sweep, which is exactly the misattribution the refusal exists to prevent.
- **That predicate depends on the boot-time `await workspaceStore.load(...)`** in `startServer` (a
  line documented there as being for Context Link). Drop it — or stop awaiting it before
  `server.listen()` — and every SSH project silently reads as local again;
  `test/server/session-memory-e2e.test.ts` fails if that happens. What is **not** load-bearing is
  where that load sits relative to the service boot: `isRemoteProject` is a closure evaluated per
  QUERY, and no query can arrive before `startServer` reaches `listen()`. The requirement is that
  the load completes before the server *serves*, not that it precedes any particular boot line.

A **headless** host boots the service like every other core service, but with no UI attached nothing
queries it.

## Security model

Single-user auth. There is one password; sessions are per-browser.

- **Password hashing:** scrypt (`N=16384, r=8, p=1`, 32-byte key, per-password random
  salt), stored as `auth.json` (mode `0600`) in the data dir. Login comparison is
  constant-time (`crypto.timingSafeEqual`). The app never stores the plaintext.
- **Session cookie:** on successful login the server sets `nt_session=<random>` with
  `HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict; Path=/` (and `Secure` when served over HTTPS). Sessions
  are persisted (`sessions.json`, mode `0600`) with a 30-day TTL and swept lazily.
  `revokeAll()` exists to drop every session but is only wired programmatically in
  Phase 2 (no logout-everywhere UI yet; `/auth/logout` clears the current cookie).
- **Origin check on WS upgrade:** the WebSocket endpoint requires a valid session
  cookie **and**, when the browser sends an `Origin` header, that its host matches the
  request `Host`. A malformed Origin is rejected (never throws). This blocks
  cross-site WebSocket hijacking. (Non-browser clients without an Origin still must
  present a valid cookie.)
- **Login rate limit / lockout:** 5 failed password attempts trip a 60-second lockout
  (further attempts get `429 too_many_attempts`); a success resets the counter.
- **Auth gate:** every route except the login/setup pages and their POST handlers
  requires a valid session — HTML navigations redirect to `/login`, API/WS get `401`.

### Reverse-proxy SSO (header trust)

Deployments that front the server with an SSO reverse proxy (Cloudflare Access,
Tailscale, oauth2-proxy, Authelia…) already authenticate every request before it
reaches nodeterm, and the proxy asserts the identity in a request header. Setting
`NODETERM_TRUST_PROXY_HEADER` makes such requests count as authenticated — no
password, setup token, or session cookie needed:

```bash
# Cloudflare Access
NODETERM_TRUST_PROXY_HEADER=Cf-Access-Authenticated-User-Email node out/server/main.cjs
# Tailscale (tailscale serve / funnel with identity headers)
NODETERM_TRUST_PROXY_HEADER=Tailscale-User-Login node out/server/main.cjs
# oauth2-proxy / Authelia / most others
NODETERM_TRUST_PROXY_HEADER=X-Forwarded-User node out/server/main.cjs
```

A request is trusted only when **both** hold:

1. its **TCP peer address** is inside `NODETERM_TRUST_PROXY_NETS` (default:
   loopback only — the same-host proxy deployment). If your proxy reaches the
   container over a private network, list it explicitly, e.g.
   `NODETERM_TRUST_PROXY_NETS=127.0.0.1,10.0.0.0/8`;
2. it carries the configured header with a **non-empty value**.

The header **content is not validated** (no JWT verification) — the trusted-network
boundary is the trust statement. That makes two things non-negotiable: only the
proxy may be reachable from the trusted networks, and the proxy must
**strip/overwrite** the header on incoming client requests (Cloudflare Access,
Tailscale and oauth2-proxy all do). A typo'd nets entry fails the boot rather than
silently changing who is trusted; setting nets without a header is likewise refused.

Everything else stays intact: password/cookie auth keeps working beside it (e.g.
for loopback ops access), the WS upgrade still enforces the same-host Origin check,
and a proxy-authed visit to `/login` or `/setup` just redirects home. The boot log
prints a `⚠️ Proxy header trust ENABLED` line naming the header and networks —
verify it matches what you meant to trust.

### TLS (reverse proxy)

The server speaks **plain HTTP** by design. For anything beyond `localhost`, run it
bound to loopback and put a TLS-terminating reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, Cloudflare
Tunnel, a VPN, etc.) in front. The `Secure` cookie flag is set automatically when the
proxy forwards HTTPS (detected via `X-Forwarded-Proto` / the request being TLS).
`--insecure-http` only exists as an explicit, eyes-open escape hatch for trusted
private networks — prefer the proxy.

### Docker / Dokploy

The repo ships a multi-stage `Dockerfile` (root) that builds the renderer + server bundle and
produces a slim runtime image with `tmux`, `git` and `curl` (the managed hook scripts POST
through curl). Any Dockerfile-based PaaS (Dokploy, Coolify, plain compose) can deploy it:

```bash
docker build -t nodeterm-server .
docker run -d -p 8443:8443 \
  -e NODETERM_SERVER_PASSWORD='choose-a-strong-one' \
  -v nodeterm-data:/data \
  nodeterm-server
```

On Dokploy specifically: create an app from this repo (Dockerfile build), attach a volume at
`/data`, set `NODETERM_SERVER_PASSWORD`, and point a domain at container port `8443` — Traefik
terminates TLS and forwards `X-Forwarded-Proto`, so the session cookie gets its `Secure` flag
and the clipboard runs in a secure context.

Things the image decides for you (see the Dockerfile comments for the full why):

- **node-pty is compiled against Node's ABI, not Electron's.** The repo's `postinstall` runs
  `electron-rebuild`, which targets Electron — every install in the image uses
  `--ignore-scripts` plus an explicit `npm rebuild node-pty`. Don't "simplify" that away.
- **`--insecure-http` is passed** because the container must bind `0.0.0.0` for the proxy to
  reach it, and TLS lives in the proxy. Never publish the port directly on a public interface.
- **A container restart/redeploy kills the tmux server** (it lives inside the container). The
  cold-restore path bridges it — scrollback replays from the `/data` snapshot and resumable
  agents relaunch with `--resume` — but running processes die with each deploy. This is the one
  behavioral difference from a long-lived host install, where only a machine reboot does that.
- **`/data` must be a volume** — auth, sessions, workspace and scrollback snapshots live there;
  without it every restart forgets the password and the canvas.

Agent CLIs (`claude` etc.) are not baked into the image — install them into the running
container (or extend the image) and authenticate inside a terminal node; their config lives
under the container user's home, so consider a volume there too if you rely on them.

### CSP

The inline login/setup pages carry a strict CSP. The built `index.html` ships with a
`default-src 'self'` marker that the server **rewrites** at serve time to
`default-src 'self'; connect-src 'self' ws: wss:;` so the browser can open the
WebSocket. If that marker is ever missing, the server logs a loud warning (the WS
would otherwise be blocked) — rebuild the renderer or update the rewrite.

### Dictation

Voice-to-text input works in the browser via the **same core speech service** the desktop app uses. Dictate with ⌘⌥D (or the dock mic button); transcribed text goes into the overlay's editable field and is sent only via explicit Send/Insert into the node that was selected when the overlay opened — nothing auto-submits. **Browser constraints:** `getUserMedia` requires a **secure context** — HTTPS or `localhost`; the microphone permission prompt is the browser's own. **Model storage:** Downloaded models (tiny free tier; larger Pro models) are stored on the **server's data dir** under `speech-models/`, persisted across sessions and server restarts.

## Documented deviations from the spec

Two intentional departures from `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-10-server-edition-design.md`:

1. **`node:http` + `ws`, not Fastify.** The HTTP/WS surface is tiny (a handful of
   routes + one WS endpoint); the built-in `http` module plus `ws` keeps the
   dependency footprint minimal and avoids a framework for no gain.
2. **scrypt, not argon2.** scrypt is in Node's standard library (`crypto`), so there's
   no native dependency to build/ship. Parameters follow the OWASP baseline.

## Phase 2 limitations

- **Terminal-only.** Terminal nodes work (spawn, I/O, resize, tmux continuity). The
  git panel, source control, Monaco editor/diff nodes, SDK chat node, agent-status
  badges/hooks, and the folder picker are **not** wired into the server bridge yet —
  their `window.nodeTerminal` methods are stubbed. Deferred to Phase 3.
- **Reconnect = full-page reload.** When the WebSocket drops, the bridge shows an
  overlay and the recovery path is to reload the page; on reload each terminal
  warm-reattaches to its still-running tmux session and tmux redraws. (The spec's
  lighter "thin reconnect strip" is recorded as a v1 tradeoff.)
- **Initial-connect failure showed a blank screen** *(resolved in Phase 3c).* If the
  server was unreachable at the very first page load (as opposed to a mid-session drop),
  the reconnect overlay did not appear — you got a blank page. The bridge now shows the
  reconnect overlay on a failed first connect instead of booting the app, and reloads on
  reopen. See [Phase 3c](#phase-3c-follow-up-hardening).
- **No backpressure / flow-control auto-trigger.** The `pty.setFlow` plumbing exists
  end-to-end, but nothing automatically pauses a flooding PTY based on WebSocket
  `bufferedAmount` yet. Deferred to Phase 3.
- **Single user.** One password, no accounts/roles.

## Phase 3a: files, editor, diff & source control

Phase 3a widens the browser surface from terminals-only to the file-and-git
workflow. The server now registers the core **fs**, **git**, and **commit-message**
handlers and the browser bridge exposes real `fs` / `git` / `files` / `context`
APIs, so several node kinds and panels that were stubbed in Phase 2 now work in the
browser:

- **Editor & diff nodes** — Monaco editor nodes read/write files over `fs:read` /
  `fs:write` (⌘S saves), and diff nodes render `git:show-file` + `fs:read` — both
  now function unchanged in the browser.
- **Source Control panel** — stage / unstage / discard, diff, branch switch/create,
  commit + push, and the ✦ AI commit message (BYO local agent CLI on the staged
  diff) all run against the server's `git` service.
- **Explorer** — the file tree lists the project `cwd` via `fs:list`.

The following affordances change shape in the browser (no native OS is reachable):

- **Folder / file picker** — there is **no native dialog**. "Open folder…" and file
  pickers use an **in-app server-directory browser** (built on `fs:list`) that lets
  you navigate and pick a path on the server's filesystem.
- **`shell.openExternal`** — opens the URL in a **new browser tab** rather than a
  desktop-side default browser.
- **"Reveal in Finder" / "open with default app"** — **inert** in the browser
  (there is no desktop file manager to reveal into); these actions are hidden or
  no-op rather than erroring.
- **Clipboard (copy)** — the browser's `navigator.clipboard` only exists in a **secure
  context** (https or `localhost`). Over plain http on a LAN it is `undefined`, so the
  bridge falls back to a hidden-textarea `document.execCommand('copy')`. That fallback
  only works **inside a user gesture**: the copy shortcut and the click-driven copy
  buttons are fine, but an `OSC 52` write driven by terminal *output* (`vim "+y`, `gh`,
  `yazi`) is not — it fails and raises a **banner** ("the browser blocks clipboard access
  over plain http"). Copy never fails silently, but if you want it to work properly,
  **serve over https (or localhost)** — that is one more reason for the TLS proxy above.
  Note also that **Ctrl+Shift+C** (advertised as copy on Linux/Windows) additionally opens
  Chromium's element inspector and a page cannot suppress that; **Ctrl+Insert** is the
  browser-safe copy chord.

The **backpressure / flow-control** gap noted in the Phase 2 limitations is now
closed: a flooding PTY is automatically paused based on the WebSocket
`bufferedAmount` and resumed when it drains, so the WS is protected.

> **Loose coordination (follow-up).** The server-side WS backpressure and the
> renderer's terminal (xterm) flow control coordinate only **loosely** over a shared
> pause actuator (`ptyManager.setFlow`) — full two-master coordination is a follow-up.
> Because either side can resume the pty independently, the server **re-asserts** its
> pause on every send while the socket buffer stays above the high-water mark (rather
> than latching on a single rising edge), so a renderer-side resume cannot silently
> latch the server's protection off.

**Still deferred to Phase 3b:** the SDK **chat node** and the **agent-status
badges/hooks** are not yet wired into the server bridge.

## Phase 3b: agent status, subagents & the context meter

Phase 3b brings the agent-observability surface — the same code path the desktop app
uses — to the browser. The server boots the loopback **hook server**
(`hookServer.start()`, on its own `127.0.0.1` port) and installs the managed hook
scripts, so every agent CLI the server spawns POSTs its lifecycle hooks back to the
host. `wireAgentStatus` installs the hook server's normalized + raw listeners and
routes each event over `platform.broadcast`, so the existing renderer badge / subagent
/ context code now works unchanged in the browser:

- **Agent-status badges** — an agent's own hooks (not output parsing) drive the shared
  4-state model; the normalized event is broadcast over `agent:status` and the header
  shows the pulsing **RUNNING** (working) / **NEEDS YOU** (waiting/blocked) badge, plus
  the unread dot and completion notification (as a Web Notification — see Phase 2).
- **Subagent visualization** — subagent start/end drive ephemeral **SubagentNode** cards
  over `agent:subagent-activity`; the main-process subagent tail streams each card's live
  transcript to the browser.
- **Context-window meter** — the per-node context tail streams `context:update` so the
  meter fills as the session's transcript grows (this channel was already real in 3a; 3b
  feeds it from the hook pipeline).

Because the hook POST carries a `transcript_path`, a forged POST is defended by jailing
that path to the system-default `~/.claude/projects` or a managed account dir
(`isSafeLocalTranscriptPath`) before any tail reads it.

### Context Link

Context Link works in the Server Edition. The feature itself lives entirely in core
(`src/core/context-link.ts`) and writes everything under `dataDir`; what it needs from a
shell is the **link map** — who is linked to whom.

The desktop gets that from its renderer, because React Flow holds the live canvas. That
does not fit here: agents and their tmux sessions keep running with the browser closed,
and a headless deployment may never have one attached. So the server derives the same map
from the **persisted** `bridges[]` of every canvas (`workspaceStore.persistedCanvases()` →
`buildBackgroundLinkMaps`, in `src/server/context-link.ts`). A workspace save re-derives
immediately; a 15 s sweep also catches transcript paths, which arrive from the hooks
rather than from any canvas change, and skips the write when nothing moved.

Consequences worth knowing:

- **Boot reads the workspace once** (`load({ sideline: false })`) so links are live before
  the first browser connects. Read-only on purpose — sidelining a conflicted
  `project.json` stays a renderer/probe decision.
- **Boot also writes into agent configuration directories** when managed hook installation
  is on: the `get-linked-context` Claude skill, plus marker-delimited instruction blocks in
  `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`, `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md` and opencode's `AGENTS.md`. The blocks are
  idempotent and preserve surrounding content. Set **`installHooks: false`** to skip every
  one of those writes — the Context Link read handler still works, agents simply have to be
  told about the shim some other way.
- **Local-only, deliberately.** No remote deps are injected (`initContextLink(pty, {})`):
  the server runs ON the host whose transcripts and tmux it reads, and SSH projects are a
  desktop-only concept.
- `contextLink.info()` is still unsupported in the browser bridge, so the canvas note that
  announces a new link cannot quote the shim path. The boot-installed instructions cover
  discovery independently.

**Deliberate scope skips (Phase 3b):**

- The SDK **chat node** is still **deferred** — it is not wired into the server bridge.
- **Canvas-control** (`agent:control`, the Claude-only `nodeterm` CLI verbs) is **not
  wired** over the server, and since the strict-verb work it says so **by name**:
  `/control/<verb>` answers HTTP 400 with `error: control-unsupported-on-this-edition`
  and a sentence containing the literal *"do not retry"*. The old generic
  `control unavailable` read to an agent like a transient outage, and an agent retries an
  outage. `browser` additionally names why it is **structural** rather than unimplemented —
  a browser node on this edition renders in the **viewer's own** browser tab, which this
  server has no debugger for, and never can. The whole `browser` drive set shipped over
  S8 (nav/read/click/type/press/scroll/wait/screenshot/cookies) is therefore **desktop-only**:
  it needs Electron's `<webview>` + CDP, which this edition has none of, so there is no
  browser driving here at all. See `src/server/control-unsupported.ts`.
  The agent-messaging verbs (`send`/`reply`/`notify`) are additionally **verified-only at
  the route** on every edition, so on this one an unverified caller gets the flat 403
  messaging refusal and a verified caller gets the same
  `control-unsupported-on-this-edition` — both terminal, neither an invitation to retry.
- The **`ptyDestroy` tail-teardown** — *resolved in Phase 3c.* Phase 3b left this skipped
  (agent tails self-cleared only on `SessionEnd`, so a node closed *without* one left an
  idle file-tail); the server now untracks agent tails on node close, at desktop parity.
  See [Phase 3c](#phase-3c-follow-up-hardening).
- **SSH-remote agent tails are N/A** — the server has no SSH-project manager, so the
  SSH branch of the desktop hook-wiring block is dropped (the raw listener falls straight
  through to the local logic).

## Phase 3c: follow-up hardening

Phase 3c closes two follow-ups left open by Phase 3b, bringing the browser bridge to
desktop parity on agent-tail cleanup and first-connect behavior:

- **`ptyDestroy` tail-teardown (desktop parity).** When a node is closed the server now
  **untracks its agent tails** (the per-node context/subagent session state plus the
  context tail and subagent tail) on `ptyDestroy`, exactly as the desktop app does — no
  more idle file-tail lingering for a node closed *without* a `SessionEnd` (e.g. the ×
  button). This was enabled by making `platform.on` **multi-listener** (matching Electron's
  `ipcMain.on`): the new teardown listener runs **alongside** `PtyManager`'s own
  `ptyDestroy` destroy handler instead of clobbering it.
- **Clean boot on a failed initial connect.** A failed *first* WebSocket connect no longer
  boots the app into a broken/blank state — the bridge shows the standard reconnect overlay
  and the app reloads on reopen, so first-load failure now behaves like a mid-session drop.

**Still deferred** (unchanged from Phase 3b): the SDK **chat node**, **canvas-control**
(`agent:control` / the `nodeterm` CLI verbs — now a *named, non-retryable* refusal rather
than a generic failure, see above), full **two-master flow-control coordination**
(the server still re-asserts its WS backpressure pause on each send rather than co-managing
a single actuator with the renderer), and the web folder picker's **hardcoded start
directory**.

### Managed Claude accounts

Managed Claude accounts (several logged-in Claude identities side by side, each with its own
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`) **work in the browser**. Selecting one always did — env injection, the
transcript readers, the usage rows and the account pickers are all `src/core` — but the
*lifecycle* was welded to `ipcMain`, so a browser-only deployment could pick an account it had no
way to create (issue #313).

- **The lifecycle is core.** `src/core/claude-accounts-service.ts` owns the four
  `claude-accounts:*` channels (add / wait-login / cancel-wait / remove) and registers them
  through the platform seam, so **both shells serve them**: `src/main/claude-accounts.ts` is now a
  thin desktop wrapper, and `registerCoreHandlers` calls the same `registerClaudeAccountsIpc()`.
  The browser reaches them through a real `buildClaudeAccountsApi` in the ws-bridge instead of the
  old `E_UNSUPPORTED` stub. `waitLogin` is a straight passthrough of a poll that runs up to five
  minutes — safe because the WS RpcClient has no request timeout, so a pending request rejects
  only when the socket drops.
- **Per-account hooks are installed at boot and at add.** A managed account carries its own
  `settings.json` (Claude Code resolves it relative to `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`), so the managed status
  hook has to be written there too or that account reports no agent status at all. `startServer`
  runs the same per-account loop the desktop does right after `installManagedAgentHooks()`, and
  `add` installs into the fresh dir up front.
- **The canvas skill is desktop-only.** Canvas control is not wired on this edition at all (the
  hook server answers `control unavailable` by name), so the service takes the skill installer as
  an optional dep and the server passes none — a per-account `SKILL.md` here would point at
  nothing.
- **No remote (SSH) accounts.** The Server Edition has no SSH-project manager, so an account
  context carrying a `projectId` takes the **local** path — the same degrade the desktop takes
  before its manager exists.

### Managed Codex accounts (S6)

The Server Edition **arms the Codex record-signing secret** but does **not** host the
account-management IPC — that surface is desktop-driven over SSH.

- **Arms the record secret (Decision 1).** At boot `armServerNodeIdentity`
  (`src/server/node-identity-arm.ts`) loads the raw node-auth secret and calls
  `setCodexThreadIdentityAuthSecret(...)` with it, so a managed Codex account's thread→node→account
  ownership records can **sign and verify on a headless host**. Headless Linux has no OS keychain, so
  the secret is 32 **raw bytes** at `node-auth-key.bin`, mode `0600` — the same both-shells channel the
  desktop seals via `safeStorage`. This only makes the record layer *able to sign*; it is orthogonal to
  the shared-app-server degrade (Codex nodes still launch bare here, exactly as before).
- **Does NOT host the account-management verbs.** `initCodexAccounts` registers its IPC over Electron's
  `ipcMain` with WebContents-owner authorization, which the headless bridge does not provide, so
  `startServer` never calls it. This is **not** a silent gap: managed Codex logins **on an SSH host**
  are driven by the **desktop** over SSH (the remote account-add / device-login / import legs + the
  relay) — the host runs the relay + import, not its own copy of the account IPC.
- **Fail-closed, both ways.** With no secret armed (unwritable key file), the record layer throws
  rather than writing anything unsigned, and Codex nodes keep working bare. A machine with **no** managed
  accounts is byte-for-byte the pre-S6 layout (a bare-root record per thread).
- **A browser-only deployment therefore cannot manage Codex accounts** — the case issue #313 is
  about. Managed **Claude** accounts moved into core (above); Codex did not follow, and the reason
  is not effort: its switch verbs (`switchThread` / `commitSwitch` / `finishSwitch` /
  `rollbackSwitch`) authorize the owning window by Electron **WebContents id**, which has no
  meaning over a WS connection where every browser tab is an equally anonymous socket. Hosting
  them headless needs a connection-identity redesign first, not a handler port. Until then the
  `codexAccounts` namespace stays an `E_UNSUPPORTED` stub in the bridge and the Settings section
  says so by name rather than failing silently — an unhandled rejection there previously stopped
  the spinner and showed nothing.

## Manual browser smoke checklist

Run against a real browser (this is the human-verified path; the automated harness
only exercises the HTTP/auth surface). With `npm run server:dev` running:

1. **Setup / login** — open `http://127.0.0.1:8443`. On first run you're redirected to
   `/setup` (or use the printed setup URL); choose a password. On later runs you land
   on `/login`; sign in.
2. **Add a terminal** — click the dock `+` and add a terminal node. It should spawn a
   shell and show a prompt.
3. **Terminal I/O** — type `echo hi` and confirm `hi` prints.
4. **Resize** — drag the node's resize handle; the terminal should re-fit (cols/rows
   update) without garbling.
5. **Refresh the page** — reload. The terminal must **warm-reattach** to its tmux
   session and redraw its current contents (running processes survive).
6. **Restart the server** — stop `node out/server/main.cjs`, start it again, reload the
   page. Same warm-reattach: the tmux server outlived the app, so state is intact.
7. **Lockout** — sign out (or open a fresh session), enter the wrong password 5 times;
   the 6th attempt should be rejected with a "too many attempts" lockout for ~60s.
8. **Open a folder (Phase 3a)** — use "Open folder…"; the **in-app server-directory
   picker** appears (no native dialog). Navigate to a git repo on the server and pick
   it; a project opens on its `cwd`.
9. **Edit & save a file (Phase 3a)** — open a file (Explorer or picker) into an editor
   node, make an edit, press ⌘S; the dirty dot clears and the change lands on disk.
10. **Source Control (Phase 3a)** — open the Source Control panel; your edit shows as a
    change. Click it to see the **diff**, **stage** it (+), type a message, and
    **commit**; the file leaves the change list and the commit appears in recent commits.
11. **Agent status (Phase 3b)** — open a **Claude** terminal node, run a prompt; the header
    should show the pulsing **RUNNING** badge while it works and clear (with an unread dot
    if the tab is unfocused) when it's done.
12. **Subagent card (Phase 3b)** — from a Claude node, run a prompt that dispatches a
    subagent (e.g. a `/task`); an ephemeral **subagent card** appears connected to the
    parent node; click it to watch its live transcript stream.
13. **Context meter (Phase 3b)** — as a Claude session accumulates transcript, the node's
    **context-window meter** should fill.
