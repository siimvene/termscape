# nodeterm skills in SSH projects

How the agent-facing skills (`manage-nodeterm-canvas`, `get-linked-context`) reach an agent
that is running on a **remote host** in an SSH project.

## The problem

Both skills were installed only into the desktop's own home:

- `manage-nodeterm-canvas` → `~/.claude/skills/…` + `<userData>/canvas-control/`
- `get-linked-context` → `~/.claude/skills/…` + `<userData>/context-links/`

An SSH project's agent runs on the **host**, reads the **host's** `~/.claude/skills`, and finds
nothing. Copying the files over would not have helped either: both shims were generated as

```sh
ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1 exec "<the desktop's Electron binary>" "<…>/cli.mjs" "$@"
```

— a path that exists on exactly one machine. And the Node CLI they exec'd talked to the hook
server over `127.0.0.1:<port>`, which on the host is the host's own loopback, not the desktop's.

## The transport (already there)

Nothing new had to be invented: an SSH project already runs a **reverse unix-socket tunnel** from
the host back to the desktop's loopback hook server, because that is how remote agents report
status (`RemoteHooks.setup`, `docs/`-less but see `src/main/remote-ssh/remote-hooks.ts`):

```
remote agent → curl --unix-socket ~/.nodeterm/hook-<projectId>.sock
             → ssh -R → desktop 127.0.0.1:<hook port>
```

The per-project endpoint file `~/.nodeterm/hook-endpoint-<projectId>.env` carries the live
`NODETERM_HOOK_SOCK` / `_TOKEN` / `_VERSION`, and every remote session's tmux env already points
at it (`NODETERM_HOOK_ENDPOINT`) along with `NODETERM_NODE_ID`. So the design rule is:

> **The remote side is a thin client.** It ships no parsing, no state and no app knowledge — it
> POSTs over the existing tunnel and prints what comes back.

## What shipped: canvas control over SSH

1. **The CLI is now POSIX sh + curl** (`CONTROL_SHIM_SCRIPT` in `canvas-control-core.ts`),
   replacing the Electron-as-Node CLI. It carries **no machine-specific paths**, so the same
   script is installed on the desktop and on the host. It picks its transport from the endpoint
   it was given: `--unix-socket $NODETERM_HOOK_SOCK` when one is advertised (SSH), else
   `127.0.0.1:$NODETERM_HOOK_PORT` (desktop). `curl` is not a new dependency — the managed hook
   script already requires it.

   The request is **form-urlencoded**, not JSON: `curl --data-urlencode` is the only escaping sh
   can be trusted with. Values like `--prompt`, `--html` and `--team` routinely contain quotes,
   newlines and `$`, and hand-built JSON in sh breaks on all three. `parseControlBody`
   (`hook-server.ts`) reads both dialects; the desktop's in-process callers still send JSON.
   A `text/plain` `Accept` makes the server render the reply, since sh has no JSON parser.

2. **`RemoteHooks.installCanvasControl`** writes the shim + `SKILL.md` onto the host at connect,
   and merges the same marker-delimited instruction block into the host's `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`,
   `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md` and `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/opencode/AGENTS.md` (that last path
   is expanded by the **remote** shell — the desktop's XDG value says nothing about the host).
   `installCanvasSkillIntoAccountDir` covers managed Claude accounts, whose sessions resolve
   skills relative to `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` and never see `~/.claude/skills`.

3. **The env gap** — `remoteHookEnvArgs` injected only endpoint/node-id/version, so a remote
   session inherited neither `NODETERM_AGENT_ID` nor `NODETERM_CANVAS_CONTROL`. The CLI gates
   itself on the latter, so the skill would have been inert on every SSH node even once
   installed. It now mirrors the local `hookServer.buildPtyEnv` exactly, `canControlCanvas`
   gate included.

### Flag syntax, and why a verb must not depend on it

Flags are `--flag value` or `--flag=value`, and a flag may carry no value at all, anywhere on the
line. The `=` form is the **only** way to pass a value that itself starts with `--`
(`open-terminal --cmd=--version`); written as two tokens, a leading `--` is read as the next flag,
so `--text --oops` sends an empty `--text` plus a stray `--oops`.

That is a deliberate trade. The loop used to consume the token after any `--flag`
*unconditionally*, so `--read --node b1` became `arg.read=--node` with `b1` dropped, and a
valueless flag was expressible only as the last token on the line. Both failures were **silent** —
the request stayed well-formed and the server answered about the wrong flag, which sends the next
debugger to the verb table instead of to the shim.

**The staleness window this lives in:** the shim is rewritten locally at every app boot, but onto
an SSH host only inside `RemoteHooks.setup()`, i.e. **on connect**. An already-connected SSH
project keeps the shim it was handed, so a parser improvement reaches remote agent nodes only
after a reconnect, with nothing on the wire to say which loop is running — the same shape as the
managed hook script's stale window. New verbs are therefore designed to parse identically under
both loops: give every flag a value and the old and new loops agree.

### Gating and failure behavior

Install is gated on **both** a resolved remote `$HOME` (every remote path must be absolute — a
literal `~` does not expand where these strings land) and a **verified** tunnel: `setup()` only
returns an endpoint path after proving the reverse forward reaches *this* app run. A skill
pointing at a dead socket is worse than no skill, because the agent retries instead of telling
the user canvas control is unavailable.

Everything else fails open, per step: an unwritable instruction file, a host without `curl`, a
dropped connection — the session runs, just without canvas control. Outside a nodeterm-spawned
session the shim exits immediately on its env gate, so it stays inert in the user's own
terminals (same discipline as the managed hook script).

## What shipped: context link over SSH

`get-linked-context` could not use the canvas-control trick as-is: its CLI was a ~230-line parser
for three transcript formats (claude JSONL, codex rollout, gemini event-sourced, plus an opencode
export), too much to express in sh — and the host may have no `node` at all.

So the same rule was applied one level deeper: **the desktop does the reading and the parsing.**

1. **The parsing moved out of the CLI** into `core/context-link-render.ts` — ordinary, tested TS
   instead of JavaScript embedded in a template literal. `renderContextLink` takes a link document
   and three injected fetchers and returns the text to print; it knows nothing about ssh, fs, or
   tmux.
2. **A `/context-link/<verb>` route** on the hook server answers with `text/plain`, and
   `context.sh` — the sh+curl twin of `nodeterm.sh` — is the only client. The local path uses the
   same route, so there is one implementation, not a local one and a remote one that drift.
3. **Remote reads were already reachable** from the desktop: a remote node's hook-fed
   `transcriptPath` *is* a remote path, read over the ControlMaster with `RemoteFile.readTail`
   (bounded — a long session's transcript is tens of MB and a `summary` shows 15 lines), and
   `PtyManager.captureSession` was already remote-aware, so `terminal` needed no new code. The
   three deps are injected by `src/main` (`initContextLink(ptyManager, deps)`); the Server Edition
   passes none and keeps its local-only behavior.
4. **A missing link in the hook path**: the remote branch of the raw hook listener never called
   `setNodeTranscript`, so a remote node had no known transcript at all. It does now — with the
   path already jailed by `isSafeRemoteTranscriptPath`, so a forged POST cannot aim a link read at
   an arbitrary remote file.
5. **`resolveLinkTranscript` refuses the local locators for a remote node.** They search *this*
   machine's disk and would have returned some unrelated local session's file — the linked agent
   would have read a stranger's conversation with nothing to indicate it. For a remote node the
   hook-fed path is the only trustworthy source; without it there is simply nothing to read yet.

### Authorization

The link document is chosen by the **requester's own node id**, and `pickLinkNode` will only
return a node listed in it. So a caller holding the hook token still cannot read a node it was
never linked to, and cannot read *through* an edge it does not itself hold (the link map is
directional). The token remains the outer boundary, exactly as for status hooks. The one value
that reaches a remote command line — an opencode session id — is shell-quoted at that site.

`docs/`-worthy consequence: at the time of this change `src/server` did not call
`initContextLink`, so context link was absent on the Server Edition. **It is wired now** —
`src/server/context-link.ts` calls `initContextLink(ptyManager, {})` and keeps the link map in step
with the canvases on disk. It passes **no remote deps**, deliberately: that shell runs ON the host
whose transcripts and tmux it reads, so local-only is the complete answer there and SSH projects are
a desktop-only concept.

## Testing

`canvas-control-shim.test.ts` runs the **real shim** under `/bin/sh` against a **real** hook
server, over both a TCP port and a **unix socket** — the shim is generated source no compiler
checks, and it is now the only canvas-control client. It covers the nasty-value round trip
(quotes / newlines / `$` / backticks / backslashes), the positional forms, error propagation,
the env gate, a bad token, a dead socket, and reading coordinates from the endpoint file.

`context-link.cli.test.ts` does the same for the context-link shim, carrying over the fixtures and
expectations of the suite that tested the retired Node CLI, so the rewrite answers for the
behavior it inherited. `context-link.handler.test.ts` drives the real handler: authorization,
the local/remote read split, and the locator guard.

## Out of scope

- **Server Edition** — canvas control is not wired there at all (no `agent:control` handler),
  which this change does not alter. The shim is now portable enough to be reused when it is.
- **Mobile companion** — no canvas, so no canvas control to surface.
- **Relay remote nodes** — a different transport with no client fs; unaffected.
