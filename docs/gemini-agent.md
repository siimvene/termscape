# Gemini as a nodeterm agent

Gemini (`@google/gemini-cli`, `gemini` on PATH — measured here at **0.54.4**) is a builtin agent id
alongside claude, codex, opencode and grok: `AGENT_CONFIG.gemini` in `src/shared/agents/config.ts` —
label `Gemini`, colour `#4285f4`, `launchCmd: 'gemini'`, `promptInjectionMode: 'stdin-after-start'`,
`expectedProcess: 'gemini'`, and **no `argvPromptSeparator`** (grok is the only agent that asks for
one, pinned in `config.capabilities.test.ts`). Status comes from gemini's own hooks, never from
parsing output.

> **Unlike grok, almost nothing here is a guess.** The CLI is installed on the machine this
> integration was built on, and it **ships its own hook reference** at
> `/usr/lib/node_modules/@google/gemini-cli/bundle/docs/hooks/reference.md` (330 lines) plus a command

## 1. What gemini is, capability by capability

Capabilities are membership lists in `src/shared/agents/config.ts`, not a flag bag. What matters for
maintenance is not *that* gemini is in a list but **what had to be true before it could join** — that
is the price of adding the next agent to the same list.

| List | gemini | What had to be true first |
|---|---|---|
| `AGENT_HOOK_TARGETS` | **joined** (pre-branch) | A normalizer for gemini's own event names (`normalizeGemini`, `src/shared/agents/normalize.ts`), a subscription list restricted to the events it maps (`GEMINI_HOOK_EVENTS`, `src/shared/agents/hook-events.ts`), and an installer — which is the *shared* one, because gemini keeps hooks in a single settings file exactly as claude does (`core/agents/hooks/gemini.ts` → `installHooksInto` on `~/.gemini/settings.json`). |
| `RESUMABLE_AGENTS` | **joined** (pre-branch) | `resumeCommand('gemini', id)` → `gemini --resume <id>`, and a session id that reaches the renderer off every hook payload. **Unverified:** that gemini's hook `session_id` is the id `--resume` accepts (its docs say so; no live run). |
| `USAGE_CAPABLE` (the per-node context meter) | **joined this branch** | BOTH numbers, from gemini's own transcript: a used count and a **trustworthy** window. Used = the newest turn line's `tokens.input` (`core/gemini-session.ts`). The window is the harder half, and the reason gemini could join at all is that its CLI states a **family rule with a catch-all default**, not a per-model table — so `geminiWindowFor` mirrors `tokenLimit()` and an unheard-of model still gets the right answer (§4). Plus a *third* thing that is easy to miss: **joining this list turns on more than the meter** — see the warning under the table. |
| `TITLE_READ_CAPABLE` | **joined this branch** (the list was created for it) | A read leg that resolves a session's own name **without searching another agent's tree** (`pickGeminiTitle` over the transcript path the context tail already tracks), and one routing rule for the readers: `readAgentSessionName` in `core/agent-session-name.ts`, serving the desktop IPC handler *and* both shells' session-name sweeps. This list exists **because of gemini**: it names its own sessions but cannot be told a name, so the read and write legs had to split (§6). |
| `RENAME_CAPABLE` | **deliberately NOT joined** | There is no rename command to write to. Gemini's session commands are `/chat` (an alias for `/resume`) with `debug | delete | list | resume | save | share` (`bundle/docs/reference/commands.md:52-100`), where `save <tag>` is a tagged **checkpoint**, not a title. One list for both legs would light the rename UI on a node where the write silently does nothing. **Invariant** (pinned in `config.capabilities.test.ts`): every `RENAME_CAPABLE` agent is also `TITLE_READ_CAPABLE`, never the reverse. |
| `PERMISSION_MODE_CAPABLE` | **joined this branch** | A per-agent **translation**, because gemini does not share claude's flag spelling: `--approval-mode default\|auto_edit\|yolo\|plan` (`gemini --help`, 0.54.4) against our `manual\|auto\|acceptEdits\|plan\|bypassPermissions`. The table is `GEMINI_MODES` in `src/shared/agents/approval-mode.ts`; §5 has the mapping and the one mode — `auto`, which is also the DEFAULT — gemini has no word for. |
| `CONTEXT_LINK_CAPABLE` | **joined** (pre-branch) | A parser for gemini's event-sourced chat format plus a locator by sessionId (`handoff/locate.ts`'s `locateGemini`), and a discovery route — the marker block merged into `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`. |
| `TRANSFER_SOURCE_CAPABLE` | **joined** (pre-branch) | The same native-transcript reader cross-agent transfer needs. |
| `CANVAS_CONTROL_CAPABLE` | **joined** (pre-branch) | The marker block in `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md` (gemini gets no skill — that is claude's discovery mechanism, which grok borrows). Membership is what sets `NODETERM_CANVAS_CONTROL` in the session env. |
| `CHAT_CAPABLE` | not joined | The ⌘M `ChatPanel` renders **claude's** transcript `.jsonl`. Gemini's transcript is a different, event-sourced shape; the panel would need its own renderer. This list doubles as the "we can read and render this agent's transcript ourselves" fact — see the warning below. |
| `SUBAGENT_CAPABLE` | not joined | Subagent cards are driven by claude's `Agent`/`Task` tool correlation; gemini's equivalent vocabulary is not mapped. |
| `BRANCH_CAPABLE` | not joined | Branch sends claude's `/branch` and resumes by claude's session id; gemini has no counterpart. |
| `RECURRING_CAPABLE` | not joined | `/loop`, `/schedule`, `/cron` are detected from claude's `Skill` / `CronCreate` / `ScheduleWakeup` tool names. |

> **⚠ Ask what ELSE a list gates before joining it.** `hasUsage` gated **three** features, not one,
> and the `USAGE_CAPABLE` join above turned on all three at once. Two of them route through
> `core/transcript-ipc.ts`'s `resolveTranscript`, which has a **cwd fallback**: when the sessionId
> leg misses — and it always misses for a gemini or codex id, since no `<that id>.jsonl` exists under
> `~/.claude/projects` — it returns *the newest claude transcript for that cwd*. So `context.ensure`
> rehydrated a codex/gemini node's meter from a **stranger's claude session** (wrong numerator, wrong

> (`src/renderer/lib/transcriptGates.ts`), which reuses `CHAT_CAPABLE` rather than adding a fourth
> list that would mean the same thing. The **meter** stays on `hasUsage`; what a non-claude agent
> gives up is only the mount-time head start — its meter fills on the first hook event after mount

## 2. The hook dialect: claude-shaped envelope, gemini's own event names

Gemini's **envelope** is the easy part. Its base input schema is claude's five fields
(`reference.md:46-58`):

```
session_id, transcript_path, cwd, hook_event_name, timestamp
```

**`transcript_path` is present** (`reference.md:53`) — the exact opposite of grok, which carries none
and forces a `(cwd, sessionId)` derivation plus a remembered `sessionId → dir` map in both shells.
For gemini the shells simply take the path they are handed, jail it, and hand it to the tail. That
one field is the difference between a five-line branch and grok's thirty.

What is **not** claude's is the event **names**. Gemini publishes **eleven** events
(`reference.md`, one `###` heading each — count it, the file has exactly eleven):

`BeforeTool` · `AfterTool` · `BeforeAgent` · `AfterAgent` · `BeforeModel` · `BeforeToolSelection` ·
`AfterModel` · `SessionStart` · `SessionEnd` · `Notification` · `PreCompress`

`GEMINI_HOOK_EVENTS` subscribes **seven** of them, and the four omissions are each for a different
reason:

| Left out | Why |
|---|---|
| `AfterModel` | **Fires per streamed chunk** — `reference.md:236`, "Fired for **every chunk** generated by the model", and its `fireAfterModelEvent(originalRequest, chunk)` call sits **inside the chunk loop** (`bundle/chunk-YMKYUNCI.js:331095`). Subscribing means one hook **process** per chunk. It is also the event carrying `llm_response.usageMetadata.totalTokenCount` — the one number worth having — which is exactly why the context meter reads the **transcript** instead (§4). Do not "just add AfterModel" to get the tokens. |
| `BeforeModel` | **NOT per-chunk** — it fires once per model request (`reference.md:189`, "Fires before sending a request to the LLM"; `fireBeforeModelEvent` at `chunk-YMKYUNCI.js:330773`, outside the loop). An earlier comment in `hook-events.ts` attributed per-chunk firing to both, and that was wrong. It is omitted for the plain reason the two below are: it reports nothing we render. A turn's start is already `BeforeAgent`. |
| `BeforeToolSelection` | `reference.md:204-219` — no state we render. |
| `PreCompress` | `reference.md:287-297` — no consumer. |

The seven map as follows (`normalizeGemini`); anything else returns `null`, a deliberate no-op:

| gemini event | `NormalizedAgentEvent` | note |
|---|---|---|
| `BeforeAgent` | `working`, `newTurn: true` | the turn start (mirrors claude's `UserPromptSubmit`); `newTurn` is what clears per-turn fan-out once per turn rather than on every tool event |
| `BeforeTool` / `AfterTool` | `working` | keeps RUNNING alive across a long tool call |
| `AfterAgent` | `done` | the turn end |
| `SessionStart` | session `start` | `source` is `startup\|resume\|clear` (`reference.md:250-251`) and maps unconditionally — a `/clear` really is one session ending and another beginning |
| `SessionEnd` | session `end` | `reason` is `exit\|clear\|logout\|prompt_input_exit\|other` (`reference.md:265-266`), likewise unconditional. Gemini subscribing `SessionEnd` is what lets the context tail untrack itself (codex does not, so its tail is released by `releaseNodeTails` instead) |
| `Notification` with `notification_type === 'ToolPermission'` | **`blocked`** + `lastMessage` | the addition this branch made — see below |
| `Notification`, any other type | **nothing** (`null`) | a **closed** match, on purpose |

### `Notification` is gemini's only ask-the-user signal, and it is matched as a closed set

Before this branch, a gemini node **sat on RUNNING while it waited for a permission answer**: the
last hook heard was `BeforeTool`, and gemini has nothing like claude's `PermissionRequest`.
`Notification` (`reference.md:272-285`) is the one signal that a human is being asked something.

`blocked` rather than `waiting` for two reasons: `normalizeClaude` already uses `blocked` for a
permission ask (every consumer treats them alike), and `BUSY_STATES` then **refuses an in-place
restart** on that node — correct, because `/quit` typed into a permission prompt would *answer the
prompt* instead of quitting. That refusal only became reachable for gemini once gemini joined
`EXIT_SEQUENCES` (§6): `restartEligibility` returns `not-resumable` before it ever consults
`BUSY_STATES`.

**The match is `=== 'ToolPermission'`, never a substring, and this is measured rather than cautious:**

- The docs name exactly one type (`reference.md:278`, `notification_type: ("ToolPermission")`).
- So does the **bundle**: `NotificationType` is an enum with exactly **one** member
  (`chunk-YMKYUNCI.js:333959-333962`), and the single call site is
  `fireNotificationEvent(NotificationType.ToolPermission, message, serializedDetails)`
  (`:362327`, inside `fireToolNotificationEvent`).
- And it fires **only for a real confirmation dialog**. `notifyHooks` is called from
  `resolveConfirmation` (`chunk-YMKYUNCI.js:340094-340101`) *after* `shouldConfirmExecute` has
  returned details; when it returns nothing the code takes `outcome = ProceedOnce; break;` and the
  notification never happens. **An auto-approved or `yolo` tool call therefore fires nothing.**

That last point is what makes gemini structurally safe from **grok's strobe**: there,
`type.includes('permission')` turned a notification grok emits before *every* tool call into a
NEEDS YOU badge plus a chime plus an OS notification plus a phone inbox card, **per tool call**.
Widening gemini's test "to be safe" is the unsafe direction — an unknown future type must stay a
no-op, because a badge stuck on a finished node has no later hook to clear it.

Nothing here can be *answered* from our side: the hook is observability only and its flow-control
fields are ignored (`reference.md:284-285`), so this reports state and no more — no `pendingId`,
unlike claude's deterministic-approval path.

### Hook installation

`core/agents/hooks/gemini.ts` is a thin wrapper over the shared `installHooksInto` on
`~/.gemini/settings.json` — **merged and idempotent**, preserving other tools' hooks, exactly as
claude's is. The event list is imported from `GEMINI_HOOK_EVENTS`; **the SSH installer imports the
same constant** (`src/main/remote-ssh/remote-hooks.ts:57-59`, `AGENT_TARGETS`). That is not
cosmetic: the two lists used to be declared separately and had drifted so far that the remote
installer subscribed gemini to **claude's** event names, which gemini never fires — remote gemini
nodes reported no status at all. One definition is the fix.

Gemini's events are **plain strings**, so its emitted config is byte-identical to what it has always
been; only grok needs the `{ event, matcher }` form of `ManagedHookEvent`.

---

## 3. Where gemini's conversation lives

```
~/.gemini/tmp/<project>/chats/session-<ISO-ish stamp>-<short id>.jsonl
```

— the same root `handoff/locate.ts`'s `locateGemini` walks, and the root the **transcript jail** was
widened to. That widening is the security-relevant part: hook POSTs can arrive over the remote
reverse tunnel, so a forged POST must not aim a file read at an arbitrary local path.
`isSafeLocalTranscriptPath` (`core/claude-accounts-core.ts:79-102`) now admits four roots —
claude's `~/.claude/projects`, a managed account's `{userData}/claude-accounts/<id>/projects`,
**gemini's `~/.gemini/tmp`**, and codex's `<codexHome>/sessions`. **Per root, never `$HOME`**: this
predicate exists precisely so a forgery cannot reach `~/.ssh/id_rsa`, and a home-wide allowance
hands that straight back.

The transcript is **event-sourced**: a line is an append, and metadata changes arrive as
`{"$set":{…}}` records that a reader folds over the ones before them. One of those records is
`{"$set":{"messages":[…]}}` — an in-session **history sync**: when gemini has to rewrite the
conversation it holds in memory (a tool result patched onto an earlier call, say), it writes the whole
array in one record, and its own reader CLEARS what it had and takes that array as the history
(`chunk-TYAF55F7.js:285852-285857` writes it, `:285303-285335` reads it). It is routine and has
nothing to do with resume — the never-resumed capture has one at line 2.

Both readers therefore scan **backwards** for the newest line that parses to something they accept
(`latestJsonLineWhere` in `core/gemini-session.ts`, shared with `codex-session.ts`), with the needle
as a cheap pre-filter only — a line can mention a key deep inside without carrying it at the top
level, and gemini's `$set` line is exactly that case.

**What a resume actually does** (measured in the same bundle, 0.54.4): it **appends to the same
file** and writes exactly one record, `{"$set":{"sessionId":…}}` (`:285453`). Nothing is replayed.
The one branch that does re-write history is the legacy `.json` → `.jsonl` **migration**
(`:285430-285450`), and even that appends each message as its own ordinary line, not as a
`$set.messages` array. This matters because an earlier version of this document — and of
`pickGeminiTitle`'s docblock — described the `$set.messages` walk as *the resume mechanism*; it is
not. See §6.

---

## 4. The context meter: `tokens.input`, and gemini's own `tokenLimit()`

**Used tokens** — measured shape, `__fixtures__/gemini/session.jsonl` line 29:

```json
"tokens":{"input":17149,"output":29,"cached":7760,"thoughts":171,"tool":0,"total":17349},
"model":"gemini-3.5-flash"
```

Both fields are on the **same line**, which is what lets one backward scan settle used *and* window.

- `input` is the used count — it is what fills the window at that turn. `total` folds in `output`
  and `thoughts`, which have already left the prompt; the fixture proves the split
  (`input + output + thoughts + tool === total` on every line).
- **`cached` is NOT added.** It is a **subset** of `input` (cached input still occupies the window and
  is already counted there), so adding it double-counts. **Claude is the opposite** — its input
  *excludes* cache reads, which is why `context-tail.ts`'s `parseLatestUsage` sums them. **The two
  formulas must not be unified.** Codex is a third variant with the same trap in the same direction
  (`cached_input_tokens` inside `input_tokens`); see `core/codex-session.ts`.

**The window** is where gemini earned its place in `USAGE_CAPABLE`. Its transcript states no
denominator, so the model id is the only signal — but gemini does not need a *guess*, because the
CLI's own resolver is a family rule with a catch-all default. Read out of the shipped bundle
(`chunk-BS6BSLZD.js:331674-331686`):

```js
var DEFAULT_TOKEN_LIMIT = 1048576;
var GEMMA_4_TOKEN_LIMIT = 256e3;
function tokenLimit(model) { switch (model) {
  case GEMMA_4_31B_IT_MODEL: case GEMMA_4_26B_A4B_IT_MODEL: return GEMMA_4_TOKEN_LIMIT
  case PREVIEW_GEMINI_MODEL: … case DEFAULT_GEMINI_FLASH_LITE_MODEL: return 1048576
  default: return DEFAULT_TOKEN_LIMIT } }
```

`geminiWindowFor` (`core/model-window.ts`) mirrors that and **only** that: the two gemma models as
the special case, everything else on the **1 M default**. The five named 1 M cases are redundant, and
copying them would only create something to go stale — an unknown or newly released gemini model gets
the *right* answer from the default, which is exactly what a per-model allowlist would get wrong,
silently, with a confident wrong denominator. The fixture's `gemini-3.5-flash` is in neither list and
lands on the default, which is evidence the default branch is the one carrying the feature.
`null` only when the transcript names no model at all — then the meter stays hidden rather than
dividing by an invented number.

Plumbing: **one tail per agent, each with its own parser** — not one tail switching on an agent id,
which would have meant changing `ContextTail.track(sessionId, path)` and its four call sites. The
poller (offset reads, torn-line carry, change-gated push) is written once in `createContextTail`;
only `parse` differs (`geminiContextParse` / `codexContextParse`). Neither gets
`onTaskNotification`/`onToolResult` — both are claude transcript features. **Both shells** create
both tails and both jail the path the same way (`src/main/index.ts:1178-1182`,
`src/server/agent-status.ts`); the desktop's copy additionally skips **remote (SSH)** nodes, whose
transcript is on the host, while the server has no SSH-project manager and so has nothing to skip.

---

## 5. Permission mode: `--approval-mode`, and the mode gemini has no word for

`activePermissionMode(agentId)` resolves the project override, else `settings.claudePermissionMode`
(the persisted key keeps its name — renaming it would silently reset every existing user's choice).
`withPermissionMode` in `src/shared/agents/approval-mode.ts` is the single funnel; **where** the flag
lands is decided one layer up by `createAgentNode`, and for gemini it goes **last** (no
`argvPromptSeparator`), so the composed line stays the historical shape.

`gemini --help` (0.54.4): `--approval-mode` `[choices: "default", "auto_edit", "yolo", "plan"]`.

| nodeterm mode | label | gemini flag | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `manual` | Ask each time | *(none)* | gemini's own `default` is documented as "prompt for approval", which is exactly what the label promises — so no flag reproduces it, as it does for claude |
| `auto` | Auto | *(none)* | **no equivalent** — see below |
| `acceptEdits` | Accept edits | `--approval-mode auto_edit` | the direct equivalent ("auto-approve edit tools") |
| `plan` | Plan | `--approval-mode plan` | "read-only mode" |
| `bypassPermissions` | Bypass all | `--approval-mode yolo` | "auto-approve all tools" |

**`auto` emits no flag, and that is the whole reason this section exists.** `auto` is
`DEFAULT_PERMISSION_MODE`, so this row decides what an **untouched install** launches gemini with.
Gemini's vocabulary is exactly those four values, and none of them means "approve most things but
NOT edits" — the nearest, `auto_edit`, is "auto-approve edit tools", i.e. the opposite end of the one
axis our `auto` is about. The first version of this table mapped `auto → auto_edit` anyway, and the
consequence was concrete: **every existing gemini node would have started auto-approving file edits
on upgrade, with no notice.** Before gemini joined `PERMISSION_MODE_CAPABLE` it always launched bare
(= gemini's `default` = *prompt for approval*), and `modeSupported('gemini','auto')` would have
answered `true`, so `unsupportedModesNote()` would not have admitted it either — a silent widening of
permissions dressed as a translation. So `auto` is **absent from `GEMINI_MODES`**,
`modeSupported('gemini','auto')` is **false**, and the launch is the bare pre-branch command. This is
the branch's own rule applied to gemini instead of exempted from it: a mode the CLI cannot express
emits no flag, never a substituted nearest match (the same reason codex's `plan` and `acceptEdits`
emit nothing). The cost is that `auto` and `manual` land on the same gemini policy — but that policy
is the *prompting* one, which is the safe direction, and the derived copy now says it out loud:

> Auto has no Gemini equivalent, so Gemini sessions start in Gemini's own default.

Pinned by `approval-mode.test.ts` ("emits NO flag for `auto`, the default mode, rather than
auto-approving edits"), which asserts the flags, `modeSupported`, the composed command line, and that
the note names gemini and the mode.

**Gemini does NOT inherit claude's `auto` version gate.** That gate exists because Claude Code
< 2.1.71 *exits 1* on `--permission-mode auto`, and it is fed by a `claude --version` probe (local, or
the SSH host's). Gemini accepts every value in the table on the version measured, so gating it on
claude's probe would downgrade a gemini session on a machine whose *claude* is old or absent.
`activePermissionMode` gates only `agentId === 'claude'`, `ensureActivePermissionMode` awaits the
probes only for claude, and `sshAutoModeHint`'s copy names Claude in every sentence for the same
reason. **An agent needing its own gate adds one beside claude's.**

**Security, re-stated because it is easy to lose:** mode values come from hand-editable, git-shared
JSON (`settings.json` / `project.json`) and end up interpolated into a shell command line (tmux
`send-keys`), so the mode is **re-validated at the interpolation site** — `isPermissionMode` at the
top of `approvalFlags`, mirroring `permissionModeFlag`. The type proves nothing. Without that guard a
forged `constructor` indexes a plain-object table and hands back a **Function**, which would have been
stringified onto the `send-keys` line. An unrecognized mode yields the bare, safe command. The same
hole exists on the **agent id** (`AgentId` is open — custom agents carry user-typed ids), which is why
`dialectFor` looks its record up through `Object.hasOwn` too, and why flag + vocabulary are ONE record
per agent (`APPROVAL_DIALECTS`): the previous shape was a `tableFor` ternary plus a `flagFor` ternary
whose `else` branch was codex's flag, so a third agent added to the table and forgotten in the flag
would have emitted `--ask-for-approval <a gemini-style value>` — a failed launch from an edit that
looks complete.

`--sandbox` is deliberately untouched: it is a separate axis, and folding it in would widen
filesystem access invisibly.

---

## 6. Title, restart, and the `--delete` trap

### The title is READ-ONLY, and that is why `TITLE_READ_CAPABLE` exists

Gemini names the conversation itself, through its own **`update_topic` tool**, so the name lives in
that call's arguments — **not** in a top-level transcript field (verified against the captured
fixture: no line parses to an object with a `title`). Measured, `__fixtures__/gemini/session.jsonl`
line 22:

```json
"toolCalls":[{"name":"update_topic","args":{…,"title":"Test Environment Verified","summary":"…"}}]
```

`pickGeminiTitle` matches on the tool **name**, so a `title` argument belonging to some other tool can
never be mistaken for the session's name, and takes the **last** call within a line (a line can hold
several; the newest is the name). Ordering across lines is right for free: the backward scan takes the
newest matching line.

**Two places, and NOT because of resume.** The reader also walks `$set.messages`, and the reason
recorded here originally was wrong: it said a resume replays the prior history into that record, so a
pre-resume title would only be found nested inside it. Measured in gemini 0.54.4's bundle, a resume
**appends to the same file** and writes only `{"$set":{"sessionId":…}}` (`:285453`) — §3. A title set
before the resume is therefore still sitting in the file as a top-level `update_topic` line, and the
backward scan finds it with no fallback at all.

What `$set.messages` really is: an **in-session history sync** gemini writes whenever it rewrites the
conversation it holds in memory (`:285852-285857`), which its own reader treats as replacing the
history (`:285303-285335`). Since that record can be the newest thing in the file and does carry
messages, a title inside it is a title the session currently believes in — so the walk is kept as
**defence**, not as the resume path. It costs nothing (the needle pre-filter means non-`$set` lines
never reach it) and it cannot invent a name: it matches only `update_topic`, and a top-level line
after the sync still wins by the backward scan. Provenance is now plain — both shapes it walks are
measured in the capture (`$set.messages` at fixture line 2, `toolCalls[].args.title` at line 5); what
was composed was the *story*, not the shapes.

The read is a **bounded tail** (`readSmallTail(p, TITLE_TAIL_BYTES)`, the same cap claude's title read
uses) of the path **the context tail already tracks**. Nothing scans. That path authority is created
per shell, so it reaches the router as an injected dep (`AgentSessionNameDeps.geminiPathFor`), and in
`src/main/index.ts` it is deliberately held in a **`let` assigned when the tail is created** and called
with `?.` (`:573-575`) rather than closed over as a `const` declared 600 lines later: the later `const`
makes an early call a **TDZ `ReferenceError`**, and `TerminalNode`'s poll does not catch its
`readSessionName` rejection — one throw kills that node's poll chain for the whole mount. A poll *can*
fire early, because `sessionId` is persisted in localStorage and a cold relaunch has one before any
hook arrives. Undefined-until-assigned degrades instead: no path, no name, next tick tries again.

There is **no write leg**. Gemini is in `TITLE_READ_CAPABLE` and **not** in `RENAME_CAPABLE`, so the
three `/rename` push sites stay claude+grok and the rename UI never lights on a node where the write
would silently do nothing.

**Routing is not cosmetic:** claude's resolver *scans* `~/.claude/projects` on a cache miss, and a
gemini session id can never be found there — so an unrouted gemini node would pay that scan on every
poll (a mounted node polls every ~4 s until the name first resolves, and the mirror's sweep adds a
pass a minute) for a guaranteed `null`.

The sweep gate lives in **core**, not in the shells: `startSessionNameSweep` defaults its `supports`
dep to `supportsTitleRead` (= `canReadTitle`, `core/session-name-sweep.ts:25`), and **neither shell
passes `supports:` any more**. That is a deliberate de-duplication: both shells previously carried
their own copy of the gate, reverting both to `canRename` left the entire suite green while silently
skipping every gemini node, so the mirror and the phone would never see a gemini name. Same drift
class bit this branch **three** times (the remote installer's event lists, the grok raw-listener
block, this) and the fix each time was one definition in `src/core`.

### In-place restart: `/quit`, and never `--delete`

`EXIT_SEQUENCES.gemini = '/quit'` (`renderer/terminal/agent-restart.ts`), measured from gemini's own
`bundle/docs/reference/commands.md:325` (`/quit`, alias `/exit`). Adding it is what makes "Restart
agent (resume)" work on a gemini node: `restartEligibility` returns `not-resumable` for an agent with
no exit sequence, before it ever consults `BUSY_STATES`.

**The value must stay BARE.** The same command takes a `--delete` flag that exits **and permanently
deletes the session's history and temporary files** (`commands.md:329-332`) — the very conversation
the restart exists to resume. A dedicated test asserts the whole written stream contains no
`--delete` (`agent-restart.test.ts`, "never types the history-destroying `--delete` flag"), and
`exitSequence('gemini')` is separately asserted `not.toContain('--delete')`.

Choreography is agent-agnostic: write `KILL_LINE` (Ctrl-U) then the exit line, poll
`pane_current_command` until a shell owns the pane, then echo-deliver `resumeCommand`. Nothing is
ever killed; a session that has not quit inside the timeout reports `exit-timeout` and keeps running.
A `working` **or `blocked`** node is refused. **Unverified:** that Ctrl-U is clear-line inside gemini's
TUI — the same assumption the module already carries for claude/codex/grok, and its cost if wrong is
one stray keystroke.

## 7. The three surfaces

| Feature | Desktop | Server Edition (browser) | Mobile (`~/projects/nodeterm-ios`) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Status hooks → badges, unread dot, notification | yes | yes — `wireAgentStatus` broadcasts the same normalized events | yes, for free — the agent-status mirror threads `agentId` and is otherwise agent-agnostic |
| `Notification` → NEEDS YOU (the fix this branch made) | yes | yes, same normalizer | yes, via the mirror's needs-you edge |
| Hook installation | `installGeminiHooks()` at launch, plus the `AGENT_TARGETS` loop per SSH connect | same core installer (`core/agents/hooks/*` is Electron-free) | N/A — the phone installs nothing |
| Context meter | yes — `geminiContextTail` + the widened jail | **yes**, wired identically in `src/server/agent-status.ts` (a rare case where the server got the feature in the same change) | the mirror's per-node context ring gets it for free — `pushContextUpdate` feeds `recordContextUsage` in both shells |
| `context.ensure` mount-time rehydration | **claude only, deliberately** (`readsClaudeTranscript`) — a gemini node's meter fills on its first hook event after mount instead of instantly | it has no server handler at all, so this was never reachable there | N/A |
| Session title read | yes | **no — pre-existing gap, not a gemini one.** `ws-bridge.readSessionName` returns `''` (`src/renderer/bridge/ws-bridge.ts:240`): `IPC.ptyReadSessionName` has never been registered server-side, so **claude's** read leg is equally stubbed. The fix is to move the routing into core and register it from both shells, exactly as `core/transcript-ipc.ts` did for the ⌘M channels | the mirror's session-name **sweep** runs in both shells and routes per agent (`supportsTitleRead`), so a gemini name reaches the phone |
| Rename write | **N/A** — gemini has no rename command (§6) | idem | idem |
| Permission mode | yes | yes (pure renderer + the flag) | **follow-up owed** — see §8 |
| In-place restart + cold-restore resume | yes | yes | N/A |
| ⌘M transcript view (`ChatPanel`) | **not implemented for gemini** — `CHAT_CAPABLE` is claude-only; the panel parses claude's JSONL | idem | idem |
| Find bar's transcript index | **claude only** (`readsClaudeTranscript`); the terminal-buffer search works normally | idem | N/A |
| Context links | yes (`CONTEXT_LINK_CAPABLE`), marker block in `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md` | wired, **local-only** — `src/server/context-link.ts` calls `initContextLink(pty, {})` with no remote deps | N/A |
| Canvas control | yes, marker block + the sh+curl shim | **not wired** — `agent:control` has no server handler; pre-existing | N/A — no canvas |
| Managed accounts | **N/A** — accounts are a claude config-dir mechanism; `createAgentNode` never stamps an `accountId` on a non-claude node, and `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is irrelevant to `~/.gemini/settings.json` | idem | idem |
| Working indicator | the **brand mark, breathing** — `brandPulsePlan('gemini', …)` returns the `gemini-color.svg` asset and it pulses with a bloom, on the canvas badge and in the notch strip. Before this branch gemini fell through to the plain dot, which says "something is happening" but not *who* | **N/A** for the notch (there is none); the canvas badge works | the phone has its own SwiftUI renderer |
| Fullscreen TUI setting | **N/A** — `claude-tui.ts` writes claude's `"tui": "fullscreen"`; gemini has no analogue | idem | idem |
| Deterministic hook-reply approvals (phone Approve/Deny) | **claude only** — `pty-manager` arms `NODETERM_PERM_WAIT_SECS` for claude alone, and gemini's `Notification` is explicitly observability-only (`reference.md:284-285`), so there is nothing to answer | idem | a gemini node's approvals are not answerable from the phone |
| Kanban card + card modal | badges, the meter row and the 💬 comments panel all work (derived from the same nodes and the same status store) | same | the iOS board is a separate read/move mirror |

## 8. Known gaps and follow-ups

**Gaps in what shipped** — state them, do not paper over them:

1. **A DENIED tool may hold NEEDS YOU until the next prompt.** On Cancel, `AfterTool` never fires
   (the Cancel branch returns before the call is even scheduled, `chunk-YMKYUNCI.js:346153-346157`)
   and `fireAfterAgentHookSafe` early-returns while `pendingToolCalls` remain
   (`chunk-YMKYUNCI.js:344652`) — so the badge is cleared by the *next* turn's `BeforeAgent`.
   Self-healing, and still strictly better than the pre-branch stuck RUNNING, but gemini has no idle
   rescue notification the way grok might. Measure it: deny a tool live and watch whether the badge
   clears (§9 item 5).
2. **`auto` and `manual` are indistinguishable at launch** (§5): gemini has no value for `auto`, so
   both emit no flag and land on gemini's own prompting `default`. Closed as far as honesty goes —
   `modeSupported` is false and the derived copy says so — but the dropdown still offers two entries
   that do the same thing on gemini. Only a gemini-side "approve non-edit tools" value could
   separate them.
3. **CLOSED, in the opposite direction** — the `$set.messages` walk was documented as *the resume
   mechanism* and listed here as unverified. Measured in gemini 0.54.4's bundle: a resume **appends to
   the same file** and writes only `{"$set":{"sessionId":…}}` (`chunk-TYAF55F7.js:285453`), so nothing
   is replayed and a pre-resume title is still a top-level `update_topic` line. `$set.messages` is a
   routine in-session history sync (`:285852-285857`), which is why the never-resumed capture has one
   at line 2. The CODE is unchanged — the walk is harmless, free and defensive — but the story is
   fixed in §3, §6 and `pickGeminiTitle`'s docblock, and the checklist item that told a tester to
   capture "the resumed transcript's `$set` shape" is gone: there is no such shape to capture.
4. **`gemini --resume <id>` is FATAL when the id does not resolve** — measured here: exit **42**,
   `Error resuming session: Invalid session identifier "…"` (and, from a directory with no chats at
   all, `No previous sessions found for this project`), so a cold-restore relaunch whose transcript
   has been deleted, or whose node runs in a different cwd than the one gemini indexed, dies instead
   of degrading to a bare `gemini`. Not fixed here (the resume command is shared with claude/codex and
   the fallback belongs in the restore path, not in a docs pass).
4. **A remote (SSH) gemini node has no meter and no title.** The tails deliberately never track a
   remote node's transcript — metering the local disk would report the wrong machine — and
   `geminiPathFor` then answers `undefined`, which reads as "no name". Honest, but a real asymmetry:
   claude's leg handles remote via `setRemoteTranscriptReader` and a remote-jailed path.
5. **FIXED** — the search button's tooltip keyed on `showUsage`, so a gemini/codex node offered
   "Search terminal + conversation" while its transcript leg was gated off. It now keys on
   `claudeTranscript`, and the guard below covers the label too.
6. **Nothing tests the call sites of `readsClaudeTranscript`, behaviourally.** No test in this repo
   renders `TerminalNode` or `Canvas`, so the gates are pinned by a source-text guard
   (`src/renderer/nodes/title-gate.test.ts`, in the style of `no-electron.test.ts`), which now covers
   the CLAUDE-TRANSCRIPT gates as well as the two title gates — `context.ensure`, the find bar's
   `searchTranscript`, the tooltip, and the inverse mistake of narrowing the meter itself. Each was
   verified by mutation. The residual weakness is the technique's: it matches identifiers, not
   behaviour, so a rename that keeps the words satisfies it. The transcript assertions are scoped to
   the matching LINE (so a failure names the site instead of dumping 6000 lines as its diff); the
   older title assertions still `toContain` over the whole file, and the "Canvas.tsx must never
   mention `canReadTitle`" clause would still false-positive on a future legitimate read there.
7. **`codexHome()` returns `$CODEX_HOME` unresolved**, so a `~/…` or relative value still misses the
   jail — pre-existing, and identical to `codex-usage.ts`'s own behaviour. It fails **closed** (the
   meter silently never fills), which is the quieter and therefore worse failure.
8. **The prefix-based jail admits a symlink planted inside an allowed root.** Pre-existing for
   claude's roots; both new consumers turn the file into numbers, never raw bytes.

**Follow-ups owed elsewhere:**

- **`~/projects/nodeterm-ios`** — the phone's `AgentLaunch.command` appends the permission-mode flag
  only for claude, so a gemini launch from the phone gets **no flag** (not a wrongly gated one), and
  `MirrorSettings.autoSupported` still has no agent dimension. Recorded from that repo in
  `docs/grok-agent.md` §8; **not re-verified here** — the iOS checkout is absent from this worktree, so
  treat the line references there as the last known state.
- **Per-agent `context.ensure` rehydration** — its own task, not a gate: teach it to resolve
  gemini's/codex's own transcripts (`handoff/locate.ts` already has `locateGemini`/`locateCodex` by
  sessionId) and route to the matching tail.

## 9. Gemini device checklist

Far shorter than grok's, because the CLI and a real transcript were both available here. These are
the items that genuinely need a running session. Run them in a project with one gemini node, one
claude node, and one SSH project.

```
Hooks + state machine
 1. Start `gemini` in a node: does the RUNNING badge appear on the first prompt and clear at
    the end of the turn? (BeforeAgent / AfterAgent reaching the hook server at all.)
 2. Trigger a real tool-permission prompt. Does the badge switch to NEEDS YOU — i.e. is the live
    payload's `notification_type` exactly "ToolPermission"? (Statically closed from the bundle's
    one-member enum, so this is a confirmation, not an unknown.)
 3. APPROVE it: the badge must go back to RUNNING (BeforeTool/AfterTool), then clear.
 4. Run a turn under `--approval-mode yolo`: NO Notification should fire at all (an auto-approved
    call never reaches notifyHooks). A NEEDS YOU here would mean the strobe grok had.
 5. DENY a tool. Expected (§8.1): the badge may STAY on NEEDS YOU until the next prompt's
    BeforeAgent clears it. Confirm, and record how bad it feels — that decides whether a rescue
    is worth building.
 6. `/clear` mid-session: SessionEnd + SessionStart both fire, the meter untracks and refills.

Context meter
 7. Does the meter fill, and does its % move as the conversation grows? Compare against gemini's
    own context readout in the TUI.
 8. Does the popover name the GEMINI model (not "claude")? And on a fresh mount, does the meter
    start EMPTY and fill on the first hook event (the deliberate loss of the head start, §1)?
 9. Run a gemma model if you can reach one: the window must be 256k, not 1M.

Title
10. Let gemini name the conversation (it calls update_topic on its own), then check the node title
    adopts it — and that a HAND rename stops the poll overwriting it (titleAuto=false).
11. RESUME that session (`gemini --resume <id>`) and check the title survives. It should, with no
    $set walk involved: a resume appends to the SAME file (§3, §8.3), so the pre-resume top-level
    `update_topic` line is still the newest one. (The item that used to sit here — "capture the
    resumed transcript's $set shape" — is gone: measured, there is no such shape.)
12. Confirm there is no rename affordance offered on a gemini node.

Modes + restart
13. Launch each mode from Settings → Agents and confirm the emitted flag: manual ⇒ NO flag,
    **auto ⇒ NO flag** (§5 — the one that matters, since `auto` is the default: a gemini session
    started with the setting untouched must PROMPT before an edit, not auto-approve it),
    acceptEdits ⇒ auto_edit, plan ⇒ plan, bypassPermissions ⇒ yolo. Check a session really STARTS in
    it, not just that the flag parses.
14. On a machine with NO claude installed, launch gemini in `acceptEdits`: the `--approval-mode
    auto_edit` flag must still be emitted (claude's version gate must not touch gemini). `auto` is
    not the probe for this any more — it emits no flag on any machine (§5).
15. "Restart agent (resume)" on an idle gemini node: does it /quit, wait for the shell, and resume
    the SAME conversation? Is it refused while the node is RUNNING or NEEDS YOU? Is the history
    still there afterwards (i.e. `--delete` was never typed)?
16. Ctrl-U inside gemini's TUI: is it clear-line? (If not, one stray keystroke precedes /quit.)

SSH + surfaces
17. Connect an SSH project, then on the host: is our hook block in `~/.gemini/settings.json`, with
    the SEVEN gemini event names (not claude's)? Do remote gemini badges work?
18. A remote gemini node has NO meter and NO title by design (§8.4) — confirm it degrades quietly
    rather than showing a wrong number.
19. Server Edition in a browser: badges, NEEDS YOU, and the context meter must all work; the node
    title will NOT adopt gemini's name (readSessionName is stubbed server-side, §7).
20. Phone: does a gemini node show the right state and a context ring? Its permission-mode flag is
    missing on phone-side launches (§8).
21. macOS notch + canvas badge: does the gemini mark pulse and bloom, in BOTH themes? Its mark is a
    gradient, so the `currentColor` bloom is the LABEL colour, not its own ink — the light theme is
    where that will look worst if it looks bad anywhere.
22. Kanban card + card modal: badges, the meter row and the 💬 comments panel on a gemini card.
```
