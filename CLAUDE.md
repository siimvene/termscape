# CLAUDE.md

This is the deep-reference for working in this repo: the invariants, why each exists, and the
measurements behind them. It is loaded automatically by Claude Code.

**Contributors: start with `CONTRIBUTING.md`** — the short version (setup, boundaries, house rules,
testing habits). This file is what you reach for when you need to know *why* a rule is the way it
is, or you are changing a subsystem it describes. A change that other developers must know about
belongs in BOTH (see Conventions).

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

**Node-based terminal manager** (BUSL-1.1, converts to MIT after 4 years — see `LICENSE`): multiple real terminals live on a single
pan/zoom canvas as draggable nodes. Target users are people with ADHD / disorganized
workflows who benefit from a spatial layout over stacked tabs. Long-term vision includes
remote access and paid features — the architecture is built so those slot in without a
UI rewrite (see Transport abstraction below).

## Platform support

macOS, Linux, and a browser Server Edition are the shipping targets; Windows is being brought up
as a first-class desktop target (extraction from external PR #276). The policy for what "supported"
means — and what you may assume when writing a feature — is three tiers, not "100% parity":

- **Core is first-class everywhere.** The terminal + agent + canvas + session-continuity
  experience must work on every desktop platform. Continuity is tmux on POSIX and, where there is
  no tmux (Windows), a standalone session-host process — the mechanism differs, the guarantee does
  not.
- **POSIX-bound edges degrade explicitly, never silently.** Some subsystems are structurally tied
  to POSIX (SSH ControlMaster, the unix-socket askpass transport, some tmux-only paths). On a
  platform where they cannot work they must either use a platform-appropriate mechanism or be
  clearly gated off — a feature that throws `EACCES`/`EPERM` on Windows because nobody checked is a
  bug, not an accepted limitation.
- **New code is platform-neutral by default.** Do not hardcode POSIX assumptions. Publish files
  through `renameAtomic`/`writeFileAtomic` (`src/core/fs-atomic.ts`), not a bare `fs.rename` — the
  guard test (`fs-atomic.guard.test.ts`) enforces this. Resolve path separators / absolute-path
  checks / file-link dialects against the filesystem-owning core's platform, not the viewer's, and
  never assume `/` or a unix socket. When a test can only run on one platform, gate it with
  `it.skipIf(process.platform === 'win32')` (or the inverse) and say why — never let it fail the
  cross-platform CI. The `windows-latest` CI job runs the platform-dependent suites on real Windows.

## Commands

```bash
npm install        # deps + rebuilds node-pty against Electron's ABI (postinstall hook)
npm run dev        # dev mode with renderer HMR
npm run build      # production build into out/
npm start          # preview the production build (electron-vite preview)
npm run typecheck  # tsc for both node (main/preload) and web (renderer) projects
npm run rebuild    # re-run electron-rebuild for node-pty if you hit ABI/native errors
```

**`rebuild` and `postinstall` both run `scripts/patch-node-pty.mjs` first, and that is not
optional.** node-pty 1.1.0's darwin `pty_posix_spawn` leaks a ptmx device on every SUCCESSFUL spawn
(an off-by-one in the low-fd cleanup) and master+slave on every FAILED one; on this app's spawn
churn that exhausts `kern.tty.ptmx_max` within hours, and terminals then simply stop opening. The
script rewrites `node_modules/node-pty/src/unix/pty.cc` before electron-rebuild compiles it.

`src/main/node-pty-patch.test.ts` asserts the marker is present in those sources, so a node-pty
upgrade that silently drops the patch fails loudly. **If that test is red, your `node_modules` is
unpatched, not your code** — run `npm run rebuild`. It deliberately does not measure descriptors
(that is environment-dependent); it checks the source the native module is built from. Upstream:
microsoft/node-pty#950 — if the fix lands there, delete the script, its wiring and that test.
```
```

`npm test` runs the vitest suite (unit + integration; the remote e2e suites skip when the
companion server repo isn't checked out). `npm run typecheck` is the fastest correctness gate.

## Process model (Electron, three contexts)

The codebase is split by Electron process boundary — keep code on the correct side:

- **`src/main/`** — Node/Electron main process. The **shell** around `src/core/`: owns
  Electron/window/IPC wiring, dialogs, and the `CorePlatform` implementation
  (`platform-electron.ts`). The renderer must never import these.
- **`src/core/`** — Electron-free service core (pty, workspace/settings stores, git,
  hook server + hooks cluster, context/subagent tails, transcripts,
  model-window, license, context-link, and the pure ssh leaves under `src/core/remote-ssh/`
  — control-master, remote-git). Talks to its shell ONLY via the `CorePlatform` interface
  (`src/core/platform.ts`); importing `electron` (or `../main/*`) inside `src/core` is
  forbidden and enforced by `src/core/no-electron.test.ts`. The Electron implementation is
  `src/main/platform-electron.ts`. This is the seam the Server Edition's `src/server/` shell
  plugs into.
- **`src/server/`** — Server Edition shell (Phase 2): plain `node:http` + `ws`
  serve the built renderer to a browser and speak a WS-RPC protocol
  (`src/shared/rpc.ts`) that a browser-side `window.nodeTerminal` shim
  (`src/renderer/bridge/`) consumes. Boots the same core services via
  `ServerPlatform` (`src/server/platform-server.ts`). Single-user auth
  (scrypt + httpOnly cookie + Origin check). `npm run server:dev` to try;
  docs/SERVER.md for details. `src/server` must not import electron or
  `src/main` (enforced by `src/server/no-electron.test.ts`). **Phase 3a** also
  serves fs/git/commit handlers (editor/diff/source-control now work in the
  browser) plus a web folder/file picker (in-app server-directory browser,
  replacing the native dialog) and WS backpressure; the renderer detects the
  bridge in `src/renderer/main.tsx` (desktop preload path is untouched).
  **Phase 3b** boots the loopback **hook server** (`hookServer.start()`) + installs
  the managed hook scripts, and `wireAgentStatus` (`src/server/agent-status.ts`)
  broadcasts `agent:status` / `agent:subagent-activity` / `context:update` over the
  bridge, so agent-status badges, subagent cards, and the context meter now work in the
  browser (transcript-path jailed against forged POSTs). It also serves the two transcript READ
  channels (`registerTranscriptIpc` — the ⌘M chat view + the find-bar's transcript index; see the
  ⌘M bullet under Agent support). Still deferred:
  **canvas-control** (`agent:control`) is not wired. (The SDK **chat node** — once listed here
  as deferred — was removed entirely, 2026-07; see the chat-node note in the node-kinds list.)
- **`src/preload/`** — the only bridge. `index.ts` uses `contextBridge` to expose a
  narrow API on `window.nodeTerminal` (typed in `index.d.ts`). `contextIsolation` is on,
  `nodeIntegration` off.
- **`src/renderer/`** — React UI. Talks to main *only* through `window.nodeTerminal`.
- **`src/shared/`** — types and IPC channel names imported by all three sides. `ipc.ts`
  is the single source of truth for channel strings; never hardcode a channel elsewhere.

PTY output flows main → renderer over per-session channels (`pty:data:<sessionId>`),
input flows renderer → main over `pty:write`. node-pty is kept **external** in the bundle
(`externalizeDepsPlugin` in `electron.vite.config.ts`) because it's a native module.

## Key abstraction: TerminalTransport

This is the load-bearing design decision. The renderer depends only on the
`TerminalTransport` interface (`src/renderer/terminal/transport.ts`), never on IPC or
node-pty directly. The current implementation is `LocalTransport` (IPC → node-pty). A
future `RemoteTransport` (WebSocket to a remote agent) implements the same interface, so
remote access / paid tiers can be added without touching the canvas or terminal UI. When
adding terminal-session features, extend the interface — do not reach around it.

## State & persistence model

**React Flow is the single live source of truth** for nodes. There is intentionally no
separate store mirroring node state — earlier dual-source designs caused sync bugs.
`src/renderer/state/workspace.ts` holds only pure helpers: the color palette, the node
factories (`createTerminalNode`, `createSshTerminalNode`, `createAgentNode(agentId, …)`,
`createAccountLoginNode`, `createStickyNode`, `createGroupNode`, `createEditorNode`,
`createDiffNode`, `createVideoNode`, `createWebNode`, `createBrowserNode`, `createDinoNode`), the
group transforms (`groupSelectedNodes`, `ungroupNodes`, `duplicateNode`), and the
`nodeStatesToFlow` / `flowToNodeStates` serializers. Node kinds (`NodeKind` in
`src/shared/types.ts`): `terminal | sticky | group | editor | diff | video | web | browser |
subagent | loop | dino` — `subagent` and `loop` are render-only (ephemeral hook-driven viz) and
never persisted. A node's `data`
carries `title, color, group, tags, collapsed, expandedHeight, shell, cwd, text,
initialCommand, filePath, diffStaged`, `agentId` (which agent CLI a terminal node runs —
persisted), and `accountId` (which managed Claude account a terminal node runs under — immutable,
resolved at creation, persisted; see **Managed Claude accounts**). `nodeStatesToFlow` defaults a
missing `kind` to `terminal` for backward compat and migrates the legacy `tags:['claude']` marker
to `data.agentId = 'claude'`. The SDK **chat node** was removed (2026-07); `nodeStatesToFlow` also
migrates a persisted `chat` node into a **sticky tombstone** in place, reading its legacy
`chatSessionId` to print a `claude --resume <id>` hint (a chat is an ordinary resumable Claude
session).

Persistence has two layers:

- **Layout + config**: schema v3. `workspace.json` (in `app.getPath('userData')`) is now an
  **index**: local folder projects are refs to `<cwd>/.nodeterm/project.json` (the source of
  truth — git-shareable, machine-portable; pretty-printed, portable `./` node cwds, monotonic
  `rev`), SSH projects are refs to the same file on the server (offline `cache` in the index,
  reconciled by rev on connect, mirrored via `SshFs` with a 5 s write throttle), cwd-less
  canvases stay inline. The renderer contract is untouched: `workspace.load()/save()` still
  speak an assembled v2-shaped `Workspace`; all fan-out lives in `core/workspace-store.ts` +
  pure `core/workspace-files.ts`. v2 files migrate on first save (backup `workspace.v2.bak`,
  one-time renderer note). Outside edits (git pull/sync) are detected by
  `core/workspace-watcher.ts` → silent reload, or a Reload/Keep-mine conflict bar when dirty.
  Unreadable refs render as greyed **unavailable** tabs (never dropped); corrupt project files
  are set aside as `project.json.corrupt-<ts>`. "Open folder…" adopts an existing
  `.nodeterm/project.json` — the probe MINTS the project id (node ids — tmux names — kept), and
  re-opening the folder is answered by the cwd lookup, not a second adoption.
  **An `unavailable` placeholder used to be a DEAD END** (issue #385): a save deliberately emits a
  header-only ref for it and never a file, so a `project.json` the user deleted was never
  recreated, every later load re-minted the placeholder, and nothing cleared the flag for a LOCAL
  project (`reopenProject` clears only `closed`; the sole `setProjectUnavailable(id,false)` caller
  is the relay reconnect). The tab went inert (`tabClickAction` → `'ignore'`) while the sessions
  sidebar — which has no concept of `unavailable` — still switched to it. An explicit "Open
  folder…" now breaks the loop, but only on EVIDENCE: `WorkspaceStore.projectFileState` reports
  `present | absent | unreadable` and **only a definite ENOENT counts as absence**, because
  clearing the flag lets the next save write the placeholder's empty canvas over whatever is
  there. Absent ⇒ clear; present ⇒ re-probe and rehydrate under the EXISTING entry id (a corrupt
  file stats fine, so a null probe keeps the placeholder); unreadable ⇒ change nothing. The
  decision is the pure `unavailableRecovery` (`renderer/lib/projectOpen.ts`), and it refuses to
  judge a REMOTE project from a local stat.
  **The shared file carries content, not identity**: no project `id`, no `viewport`, no
  `defaultAccountId` — those are machine-local and ride the index entry (`IndexEntryV3`), beside
  `localApprovalId`/`localExec`. Two folders holding the same committed canvas (worktree, branch
  checkout) are two independent projects, and the committed file is byte-identical on every
  machine. The file still carries a machine-INDEPENDENT legacy `id` (`legacyFileId`, derived from
  the canvas name) for one release, because a pre-change build sidelines an id-less file to
  `.corrupt-<ts>` inside the user's repo; it is ignored on read. Residual: node ids are still
  shared, so two worktrees still attach the same tmux sessions.
  **SSH mirror safety** (the ".nodeterm reset itself" bug — 12 fresh project ids and 45 orphaned
  tmux sessions in one field report): remote writes are atomic (`cat > f.tmp && mv`, `sshWriteArgs`);
  a mirror is never blind-written before the entry has read-compared the server file once
  (`WorkspaceStore.reconcileSsh` — the single decider; a checked read's `error` ≠ `absent`, and on
  error it decides NOTHING); cross-lineage conflicts (re-added folder, second machine, git checkout:
  the server file carries a different project id) are settled by content, not rev alone — an empty
  side never beats a populated one, adoption re-keys the file to the local project id (node ids =
  tmux session names are kept so terminals reattach), and a push outbids the losing lineage's rev;
  a throttled trailing write that drops after its optimistic ack re-owes the mirror
  (`markUnmirrored`); pending mirrors are flushed before the ControlMasters die at quit; and the
  SSH dialog **dedupes by endpoint+remoteCwd** (`openSshProject`, same contract as
  `openFolderProject`) instead of minting a fresh empty project for a folder that already has one.
- **Live terminal sessions** (tmux): terminals continue where they left off across node
  remounts *and* full app restarts, including running processes. See below.

`settings.json` is a separate store (`core/settings-store.ts`, `state/settings.ts`).

## Projects (tabs)

Each project is one canvas/page; terminals and notes belong to a project. The `projects`
zustand store (`renderer/state/projects.ts`) holds project metadata + the *serialized* nodes
of all projects. **React Flow remains the single live source of truth for the *active*
project's nodes only.** The contract:

- The active-project effect in `Canvas.tsx` (keyed on `activeProjectId`) loads that project's
  serialized nodes into React Flow. `loadingRef` suppresses dirty-marking during this load.
  A real switch applies the project's saved viewport; an **in-place reload**
  (`reloadActiveProject` — external file change / SSH reconcile) sets `preserveViewportRef` so
  the load **keeps the user's current camera** — the incoming file's viewport is wherever
  another machine last saved, and restoring it mid-work teleported the camera (most visibly
  right after a cross-project sidebar focus, when the connect-time SSH reconcile landed a
  second after fitView centered the node).
- **Project order = array order**, and it is ONE order shared by the tab bar and the sessions
  sidebar (the sidebar no longer hoists the active project to the top). Both surfaces reorder
  via drag-drop through `reorderProject(draggedId, beforeId|null)` (null = to the end; tab
  strip empty area and sidebar body are the end-drop zones), persisted like any node reorder.
  Sidebar disclosure is **persisted**, for group frames as well as projects:
  `settings.sidebarCollapsedItems` maps `project:<id>` / `project:<id>:group:<groupId>` → collapsed
  (`isGroupCollapsed`), and `settings.sidebarAutoCollapse` (default on) now only supplies the
  DEFAULT for a project row nobody has toggled (on = active expanded / others collapsed, off =
  everything expanded). **This deliberately replaced the old "a project switch resets every manual
  toggle" effect** (2026-08, with the nested sidebar tree): a tree the user shaped by hand should
  still be that shape after a restart, and one transient rule for projects plus a sticky one for
  frames would have been two contracts in one list. `projectHeadClickAction` is unchanged — an
  inactive project row switches, the active one toggles its own (now persisted) collapse — and
  every write **prunes** keys that no longer address a live project/frame (`pruneCollapsedItems` /
  `liveCollapseKeys`), because settings.json is forever and a canvas churns through group ids.
- The bottom-left **canvas lock** freezes the CAMERA only (pan/zoom): nodes stay draggable,
  resizable and connectable while locked — the point is "stop the map sliding", not "freeze
  the work".
- Before any project switch / add / delete, `commitActiveToStore()` serializes the live
  React Flow nodes back into the store, so nothing is lost. Then disk is written.
- Switching away unmounts the old project's `TerminalNode`s → their tmux clients detach but
  the sessions keep running; switching back reattaches. tmux session names are per-node-id
  (globally unique), so projects never collide.
- The tab caret menu's **Close project** (`closeProject`) is **non-destructive**: it sets
  `project.closed = true` (hidden from the tab bar, kept on disk with all nodes) and leaves the
  tmux sessions running, so closing just detaches like a project switch. Closed projects are
  reopenable from the **"Recently closed"** list on `WelcomeScreen` (`reopenProject` → restores
  nodes, which reattach warm or cold-restore). `hasProjects` counts only **open** projects, so
  closing the last open one shows the welcome screen. **Permanent** deletion (`deleteProject`:
  `transport.destroy(nodeId)` per terminal + drop agent status + SSH teardown) now only happens
  via the `×` on a "Recently closed" entry.
- A project's `cwd` (folder picker, `dialog:select-folder`) is passed to terminal/Claude
  node factories so new terminals open there. **Folder ↔ project is deduped:** "Open folder…"
  reuses the existing project with that `cwd` (and its nodes) instead of creating a duplicate.

## Terminal session continuity (tmux)

`src/core/pty-manager.ts` runs each terminal inside a persistent tmux session
(`tmux new-session -A -D -s nt-<nodeId>`) on a dedicated socket (`-L node-terminal`) with
a generated config (`-f <userData>/tmux.conf`, so the user's `~/.tmux.conf` never
interferes; status bar off, **mouse on**, 50k history, `set-clipboard on` + `terminal-features
",*:clipboard"`, and the copy-mode mouse bindings). Because the tmux *server* outlives the app,
sessions survive when no client is attached. `src/shared/ssh.ts`'s `remoteTmuxConf` is the same
config for an SSH project's remote tmux.

**Every REMOTE tmux invocation starts with `remoteTmuxPathPrologue()`** (`shared/ssh.ts` — PATH
**append**: `/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, `/opt/local/bin`, `$HOME/.local/bin`): an ssh
exec channel gets a non-login shell, and on a macOS host Homebrew's `shellenv` lives in
`~/.zprofile`, so a host whose own terminal runs tmux fine answered
`zsh:1: command not found: tmux` to every command of ours (issue #449 — the same class as the
remote claude probe's login-shell + PATH fix). Append, never prepend: a PATH that already resolves
tmux keeps exactly that binary, so nothing re-pairs a long-lived tmux server with a different
client build. When tmux is genuinely absent the interactive spawn (`tmuxOrExplain`,
`control-master.ts`) prints what is missing, how to install it and what a tmux-less remote loses,
then degrades to a plain login shell — mirroring the local plain-shell fallback; the raw
`command not found` line must never be the user-facing error again.

**tmux owns the mouse — scrolling, selection, and the alternate screen are all its job.** This is
the native behavior, and it is deliberate:
- **The wheel scrolls tmux's own history** (`history-limit`), not the emulator's buffer.
- **The pane is on the alternate screen** (`\e[?1049h`) — capabilities are NOT blanked — which is
  what keeps a full-screen TUI's input box *put* instead of scrolling away with the text.
- **Selection is tmux copy-mode.** A drag copies; apps that request mouse tracking themselves
  (vim, htop) still get their own mouse events — tmux forwards those regardless.

**Do not take scrolling away from tmux again.** A previous design did exactly that (`mouse off` +
`terminal-overrides ',*:smcup@:rmcup@:indn@'` to keep tmux on the *normal* screen, so its output
flowed into xterm's scrollback, which was then hydrated from `tmux capture-pane` on reattach). It
failed structurally: **tmux is a screen PAINTER, not a stream.** Every redraw (attach, resize,
refresh) erases and repaints, so blank and duplicated rows leaked into the emulator's scrollback —
users saw black bands and duplicated screens when scrolling up — and the pane stopped behaving
natively. The hydration that design needed is gone (see the reattach seeding below).

**Copy → the system clipboard, via OSC 52.** `set-clipboard on` **plus** `set -as terminal-features
",*:clipboard"`: on copy, tmux emits OSC 52 to the attached client, and the renderer's OSC 52
handler (`parseOsc52` in `terminal/osc52.ts`, applied in `TerminalNode.tsx`) writes the system
clipboard. Two traps, both measured on
tmux 3.4:
- **The `terminal-overrides ',xterm*:Ms=…'` entry does NOT work on tmux 3.2+** — with it, a copy
  emitted **zero** OSC 52 to the client. `terminal-features` is what actually enables the sequence.
  Do not "fix" the `Ms=` override back; it is why copying from SSH sessions never worked.
- **No `pbcopy` pipe.** The copy-mode bindings are bare `copy-pipe-and-cancel` (no command): piping
  to `pbcopy` was macOS-only, and over SSH it would have copied on the *remote* host anyway. OSC 52
  is cross-platform and works over SSH.

**A tmux client is not necessarily a watcher.** `SessionInfo.clients` is a COUNT
(`#{session_attached}`), never a boolean, because one session can hold several: the app's painter,
the user's own `tmux -L node-terminal attach`, a second nodeterm on the same socket, and our own
**control-mode shadows** (`PtyManager.shadowAttach`, used for background writes without spawning a
painter). The session reaper subtracts ours via the `shadowed` seam — a shadow is a real client but
not a watcher, so a shadowed session must stay exactly as cullable as an idle detached one.

The count is carried numerically rather than collapsed at parse time **because the subtraction
needs it**: a session holding our shadow AND a real client must still read as attached, and a
boolean could only be forced to false — reaping the session out from under whoever that other
client belongs to. **Any future reader of `list-clients` / `session_attached` owes the same
subtraction.**

Lifecycle, by intent:
- **Offscreen release (in place, 2026-08-11)** → a mounted node fully offscreen past
  `settings.offscreenTerminalMinutes` detaches its PTY client and disposes its xterm without
  unmounting (plate shown; tmux keeps running; reattach-redraw on approach, measured <500 ms).
  See the Terminal node lifecycle section for the two invariants (mount-stable observer;
  `session.source` remote gate). Note the released node is a DETACHED tmux session — it joins
  the session reaper's candidate pool (6 h grace still protects it).
- **Every memory lever must ask whether the kill ends live work** (`terminal/live-work.ts`). The
  renderer reclaims terminal memory in FOUR places — park window expiry, the park's LRU cap, the
  memory-pressure drop (all three in `park-budget.ts`) and the offscreen viewer release
  (`offscreen-policy.ts`) — and all four were written as if dropping a PTY client were free,
  because "the tmux session keeps running and re-attach redraws". **That sentence is only true
  where tmux is actually underneath.** On the plain-shell fallback (no tmux installed, tmux
  switched off in settings, or an install path `findTmux` missed) the pty IS the shell, so the
  identical call kills it and everything under it — an agent CLI mid-turn included. Issue #126: a
  project switch terminated a working Claude agent, which then auto-resumed from wherever the kill
  landed. The predicate is deliberately the narrowest one that closes it — a tmux-backed session is
  never protected (the kill costs a redraw), and neither is a plain terminal, a finished agent or
  an unknown state (nothing is running to lose). **A fifth lever owes the same gate.**
- **Node unmount (project switch)** → the RENDERER **parks** the terminal (`TerminalNode.tsx`
  `parkedTerminals`): the xterm instance + its attached PTY stay alive with the `.xterm` element
  detached from the DOM, so a remount within `TERM_PARK_MS` (5 min) re-adopts them — instant, and
  exact (the tmux client never detaches, so mouse-tracking/alternate-screen modes and scrollback
  carry over; do NOT "optimize" this into a respawn+redraw — a fresh xterm on a reused client
  misses the attach-time mode sequences and breaks scrolling). The park timer then runs the real
  teardown: `kill()` detaches the PTY client; the tmux session keeps running. WebGL contexts are
  **viewport-scoped and budgeted** (browsers cap ~16 live contexts, and a canvas holds far more
  terminals). A per-terminal `IntersectionObserver` (`rootMargin` pre-announces approach) only
  REPORTS visibility to a **module-level budget coordinator** (`terminal/webgl-budget.ts`) that owns
  every grant decision and all timing: it keeps the contexts WE hold at/under the live budget
  (`WEBGL_BUDGET` 12 default — the browser Server Edition; on DESKTOP main raises Chromium's cap
  itself via `--max-active-webgl-contexts` = 32 and boot raises the budget to 24 via
  `setWebglBudget`, constants in `src/shared/webgl.ts`) so
  the browser never has to **force-evict** — which is the bug that flashed Chromium's dead
  "lost context" placeholder (white box + sad-face) on a visible terminal during a fast pan / zoom
  out, because the old per-node observers each acquired independently and momentarily overshot the
  cap. Rules: a client granted only after an **acquire debounce** (`WEBGL_ACQUIRE_DEBOUNCE_MS`, so a
  pan-through never grabs a context for a two-frame flash); if granting would exceed the budget,
  **reclaim on demand from the least-recently-visible HIDDEN holder** (`hiddenAt` LRU order);
  if every holder is currently visible (zoomed way out), the newcomer is NOT granted and **stays on
  the DOM renderer** — we never push past the budget. A hidden holder keeps its context
  **indefinitely** (warm for a pan-back of any length) — there is no time-based release; it is
  reclaimed strictly on demand, either by a visible newcomer that needs its slot or by
  `releaseAllHiddenGrants` (queued through the drain) under memory pressure. `acquire()`
  returning false (WebGL2 unavailable) doesn't burn a slot; an externally-lost context
  (`onContextLoss`) is reported via `handle.contextLost()`, drops from the accounting, and — for a
  still-VISIBLE client — schedules ONE delayed budget-gated re-grant (sleep/wake GPU resets lose
  every context at once with no visibility change; without this every woken terminal sat on the
  DOM renderer until panned out and back). The NODE still never re-acquires itself (that loop is
  the eviction fight the design fears): the retry goes through `tryGrant` — never exceeds the
  budget, never reclaims a visible holder — and stops after `WEBGL_LOSS_STREAK_MAX` consecutive
  losses (visibility transition resets). The node registers via `registerWebglClient` on mount
  and `handle.dispose()`s on unmount (which releases + cancels timers). A parked terminal is
  off-screen so it holds no context. Permanent-delete paths call `disposeTerminalOnUnmount(id)` so a
  deleted node disposes instead of parking.
  **Which renderer a terminal uses** is `settings.terminalGpuRendering`, resolved by the single
  resolver `resolveTerminalRenderer(value)` (`src/shared/webgl.ts`) to `dom | webgl | shared`:
  `'off'` = xterm's DOM renderer, `'on'` = one budgeted WebGL context per terminal (everything the
  paragraph above describes), `'shared'` = **glyphgrid**, ONE canvas-wide WebGL2 context every
  terminal paints into (`src/renderer/glyphgrid/`, reached through `terminal/glyphgrid-attach.ts`;
  the per-terminal budget is OFF in this mode). `'auto'` (the default, and what legacy/unknown values
  fall back to) = **`webgl` on EVERY platform**, macOS included. The macOS branch has moved twice:
  it was `dom`, then `shared` on 2026-08-05 (per-terminal WebGL composited terminals black after
  zoom-out bursts, blamed on the OS compositor), and is now `webgl` — the blackout was root-caused
  not to context count but to a dependency skew (addon-webgl 0.19's dispose crashed on the 5.5 core
  and aborted its own DOM-renderer restore; pinned + healed, see
  `renderer/terminal/webgl-addon-pair.test.ts`). What actually guards macOS is a lower budget,
  `WEBGL_BUDGET_DESKTOP_MAC` (16, vs 24 elsewhere), capping compositor pressure at every zoom. The
  four-way setting stays as the escape hatch: `'shared'` is now opt-in only (also where the macOS
  default points back if the one unconfirmed 2026-07-30 whole-window-flicker report recurs), and
  `'off'` drops GPU rendering entirely.
- **Window close / app quit** → clients detach (`PtyManager.killAll()`); the tmux session keeps
  running. `killAll()` deliberately does NOT kill sessions.
- **Node reopen / app relaunch** (nothing parked) → a new PTY attaches to the same
  `nt-<nodeId>` session and tmux redraws current state.
- **User clicks ×** → `destroy(persistKey)` runs `tmux kill-session`, permanently ending it. For a
  REMOTE node it kills the remote session **and then the local one of the same name** — normally a
  no-op, but it reaps the orphan the pre-`requireRemote` local fallback below could leave behind.
- **A remote node is NEVER spawned locally** (`PtyCreateOptions.requireRemote`). `sshRemote` says
  "here is the master to run over"; `requireRemote` says "and if there isn't one, spawn NOTHING".
  Without it, a create with no `sshRemote` falls through to core's local tmux/plain-shell branches
  — which is how an SSH project's terminal opened while the ControlMaster was down (no network,
  host unreachable, `ssh` missing) quietly became a LOCAL shell in the local `$HOME`: same node id,
  same `SSH user@host` header chip, the REMOTE session's scrollback snapshot replayed into it, and
  — for an agent node — a cold-restore `claude --resume <remote session id>` running on the wrong
  machine under the local account, leaving an orphaned local `nt-<id>` behind. Refused on both
  sides: the renderer never calls `create` when `resolveSshRemote` came back empty
  (`CoState.offline` + the node's Reconnect button), and core refuses in `spawnNew`
  (`PtyCreateResult.unavailable`) so a master that dies inside the round-trip can't sneak through.
  The refusal is **only** in `spawnNew` — a co-attach JOIN to a live session for that node id is
  still correct. An offline node reports itself to `SshReconnector`, so the canvas heals itself;
  `retryNow` (banner Reconnect / node Reconnect) skips the backoff and clears the refuse window.
- **"Restart agent (resume)"** → deliberately NOT a session lifecycle event: `terminal/
  agent-restart.ts` restarts the agent CLI *inside* the pane and leaves the PTY, the tmux session
  and its scrollback untouched. It exists for **new-model pickup** — a freshly released model only
  shows up in a CLI's model list on a fresh launch, and doing that by hand means closing and
  re-resuming every agent node on the canvas. Choreography: write the CLI's own exit line (`/exit`
  for claude, `/quit` for codex — that table is also the gate, an agent not in it can never be
  restarted in place), poll `pty:pane-command` (`#{pane_current_command}`, local tmux socket or the
  project's SSH ControlMaster; any failure reads as "not a shell yet") every `RESTART_POLL_MS`
  (250 ms) until a SHELL owns the pane, then echo-deliver `resumeCommand(...)` — the same
  `claude --resume` / `codex resume` the cold restore uses. **Nothing is ever killed**: if the CLI
  has not quit within `RESTART_EXIT_TIMEOUT_MS` (6 s) the run reports `exit-timeout` and leaves the
  session running. A `working` **or `blocked`** session is refused — `/exit` typed into a
  permission prompt would ANSWER it, not quit — and a node is held one-restart-at-a-time until the
  resume line has actually LEFT the pane (an un-submitted line is where a second `/exit` would be
  spliced in). The bulk action runs the same per-node closure sequentially over every idle agent
  node in canvas order and reports one summary line. `performRestartResume` is now a COMPOSITION of
  `performExitPhase` + `performResumePhase` (2026-08-12, behavior-pinned split) — hibernation
  drives the halves separately; each half refuses independently.
- **Agent hibernation ("Eco", 2026-08-12, OPT-IN default off)** → `settings.agentHibernationEnabled`
  (+ `agentHibernationIdleMinutes`, default 30; Settings → Agents): a 60 s renderer sweep
  (`Canvas`) exits the CLI of up to **2** agent nodes per pass that are hook-idle in state `done`,
  fully offscreen (`isNodeWatched` — an open kanban card modal counts as watched), local, idle ≥
  window, non-recurring, without live subagents (`planHibernation` +
  `lib/hibernationCandidates.ts`, both pure/tested). tmux + shell survive; node shows a clickable
  SLEEPING chip; wake (view / chip / modal open) verifies a SHELL owns the pane
  (`isShellCommand` OR the persisted `hibernatedPane` the exit settled on — nu/pwsh users) before
  the KILL_LINE'd, echo-verified `withPermissionMode(resumeCommand(...))`. Sweep/wake/menu-restart
  share ONE `guardConcurrentRestart` set. Load-bearing rules a refactor must not undo:
  (1) **recurring fact is durable** — both loop-card dismiss surfaces route through
  `lib/loopCard.ts`, which HIDES a cron/schedule card but retains `agentStatus.loop`
  (`dismissed: true`); clearing it would let Eco `/exit` a CLI whose cron wakeup lives in that
  process. (2) **Fire-time re-asks**: still-offscreen, remote, eligibility — a plan-time verdict
  is stale by seconds. (3) `hibernated` **self-heals** on live hook states + SessionStart (never
  on `done` — a late Stop POST must not undo a just-performed hibernate); cold restore (`fresh`)
  clears it and lets the normal auto-resume own the node. (4) **Ordering with offscreen release**:
  Eco defers the Phase-2 viewer release until the node hibernates (hard cap idle+offscreen), but
  ONLY when the idle clock is known (`idleKnown` — `lastEventAt` is transient, so after an app
  restart nothing can hibernate and deferring would make Eco a memory regression). Eco is
  structurally inert for sessions with no turn in the current app run — documented follow-up.
  Device checklist (8 items) in PR #130 — owed before recommending Eco to anyone.

The node id is the `persistKey` (passed to `transport.create`), so it must stay stable.
If tmux is unavailable, `PtyManager` falls back to a plain shell (no cross-restart
continuity). `findTmux()` resolves an absolute path because GUI apps don't inherit the
shell PATH, and it tries three sources **in this order: fixed system paths → the shell's
PATH → the tmux the macOS app SHIPS** (`bundledTmuxPath`). System first is deliberate — a
machine that already has tmux keeps using its own, so the bundled copy is a floor, never an
override. `resourcesPath` is `undefined` on the **Server Edition**, so the bundled binary is
unreachable there by construction; a Linux host is expected to have its own. Under
`electron-vite dev` the last candidate resolves against `process.cwd()`, which is where
`scripts/build-tmux.mjs` writes its artifact. If tmux is unavailable from all three,
`PtyManager` still falls back to a plain shell; `TMUX`/`TMUX_PANE` are stripped from the child env to avoid nesting refusal.

### Cold restore (machine reboot)

tmux only survives an **app** restart — a **machine reboot kills the tmux server**, so every
`nt-<nodeId>` session is gone. To bridge that, `create()` returns `PtyCreateResult` with a
`fresh` flag: it runs `tmux has-session` *before* spawning, so `fresh=false` means a warm
reattach (tmux redraws) and `fresh=true` means a cold start (first open OR post-reboot). On a
cold start the renderer (`TerminalNode.tsx`) reconstructs state instead of relying on the dead
session (you can't keep a live OS process across a reboot):
- **Scrollback replay** — `core/scrollback-store.ts` keeps a byte-capped (`256 KB`) snapshot of
  each tmux session's recent output under `<userData>/terminal-scrollback/`, refreshed on a
  timer (`SCROLLBACK_SNAPSHOT_MS`) + on detach/quit (`tmux capture-pane -e`). On a cold start the
  renderer reads it via `pty.readScrollback` and writes it back into xterm (with a "session
  restored" separator). Warm reattach skips it (tmux already redraws). Deleted with the node in
  `destroySession`.
- **Agent resume** — on a cold start of a node whose `agentId` is in `RESUMABLE_AGENTS`, the
  renderer re-launches the agent CLI: `resumeCommand(agentId, sessionId)` (from the session id
  persisted in `agentStatus` localStorage — `claude --resume`, `codex resume`, `gemini
  --resume`) when known, else the bare `launchCmd`. The one-shot `data.initialCommand` still wins
  on the very first open, so the agent is never double-launched.

### We have our own VT emulator — check it before asking tmux

xterm.js is not just a renderer. It parses the pane's output stream, so it **tracks DECSET modes
itself** and exposes them as public API (`term.modes`, `@xterm/xterm/typings/xterm.d.ts:1865`) —
bracketed paste, application-cursor, mouse tracking, origin mode, and the rest. We already read one
of them: `term.modes.mouseTrackingMode` decides whether a click means "follow this file link"
(`src/renderer/terminal/file-links.ts:341`).

We once did the opposite. `PtyManager.bracketPasteRequested` (now **deleted** — see the tombstone
in `pty-manager.ts`) asked **tmux** for the same class of fact, via `#{bracket_paste_flag}` — and
that format **first shipped in tmux 3.7** (2026-06-26). Ubuntu 24.04 LTS ships 3.4, Ubuntu 22.04 →
3.2a, Debian 12/13 → 3.3a/3.5a, Ubuntu 26.04 → 3.6a. On all of those it expanded to `''` exactly
like a bogus name, and the comparison against `'1'` answered **false for every pane**. The bundled
tmux did not rescue it: `extraResources` places it under `"mac"` only, and `bundledTmuxPath` is
deliberately the **last** candidate (see the comment at `pty-manager.ts:245-250` — preferring our
binary would pair a new client with the user's older running *server*, which upstream refuses). On
an **SSH project it was unfixable from our side entirely**: the remote's tmux is whatever the
user's server has.

**The rule this is an instance of: before asking tmux, ssh or `ps` something about a pane, check
whether the emulator already knows it.** Facts about *what the app in the pane is doing* (VT modes,
the alternate screen, the cursor shape it asked for) arrive as bytes we already parse. Facts about
*the session* (does it exist, what is the foreground process group, which panes are in it) are
genuinely tmux's and must be asked. Mixing the two up is how a feature acquires a dependency on a
tmux version we do not control. herdr has no version problem here for exactly this reason — it
reads `mode_get(MODE_BRACKETED_PASTE)` from its own state machine.

**Measured, and the emulator is NOT the answer here.** The `?2004h` a tmux *client* receives is
tmux's own paste-through on the outer terminal (`tty_start_tty`, gated on the outer terminfo
`BE`/`BD`), not the pane app's request: it arrives ~5 ms after attach and reads `true` even for a
pane running `sleep 30`. It never toggled across pane switches, window switches, re-attach or
co-attach. A constant is not a signal — so `term.modes.bracketedPasteMode` cannot stand in for the
pane's state, however tempting the symmetry with `mouseTrackingMode` looks.

**The actual fix is older than the problem: `paste-buffer -p`.** From tmux's own man page — *"If
`-p` is specified, paste bracket control codes are inserted around the buffer **if the application
has requested bracketed paste mode**."* Introduced 2012-03-03, shipped in **tmux 1.7**, so it is
present on every tmux in the field. We do not have to ask whether the app wants framing; we ask
tmux to do the framing, and it applies the pane's real state. Measured on 3.4: framed when the app
requested it, unframed when it did not, correct for a non-active pane, and the whole thing in one
round trip —
`tmux load-buffer -b nt - \; if-shell -F -t <target> '#{pane_in_mode}' 'send-keys -t <target> -X
cancel' \; paste-buffer -d -p -r -b nt -t <target> \; send-keys -t <target> Enter` (`-r` keeps
`\n` as `\n` instead of tmux's default `\n`→`\r` rewrite; see `tmux-naming.ts`).

Two hazards that come with it, both measured:
- **Copy mode silently unframes.** With `#{pane_in_mode}` = 1, `paste-buffer -p` delivers unframed
  (tmux checks the copy-mode screen, not the app), so a user who scrolled the wheel up gets the
  one-turn-per-line bug. The `if-shell` guard above runs `send-keys -X cancel` first — only when the
  pane is in copy mode — in the same invocation, restoring it.
- **`set-buffer -- "$text"` hits ARG_MAX** around 200 KB. Use `load-buffer -` over stdin — and on
  the SSH path that means piping into the remote command rather than putting the text in argv.

There is no longer a probe or a fallback to weigh: `sendText` delivers through `paste-buffer -p`
**unconditionally** (the plan builders live in `tmux-naming.ts`). The old two-step path — probe
`#{bracket_paste_flag}`, and on a false answer deliver `line1\nline2\nline3\r`, raw newlines into
the app that *mangled* every multi-line write on a pre-3.7 tmux — is gone with the probe.

### Seeding a fresh xterm (`attachReplay` / `seedPaint` in `terminal/terminal-config.ts`)

A newly mounted xterm is empty. Since tmux paints its own client, there is usually **nothing to
seed** — the cases are:
- **`none`** — the terminal was **parked** (its buffer is still live and correct), or it is a
  brand-new node with an `initialCommand`. Seeding either would duplicate content.
- **`cold-snapshot`** (`fresh` — reboot/first open) — the tmux session is genuinely gone, so replay
  the persisted `scrollback-store` snapshot, with a "session restored" separator.
- **`warm-attach`** (`!fresh` — app restart, tmux still alive) — **seed nothing.** tmux is attached
  to this client: it redraws the visible screen and owns the history under the wheel. This is where
  a `warm-history` hydration (`transport.captureHistory` → `tmux capture-pane`) used to run; it was
  **removed**, because writing into a buffer that tmux then repaints is what produced the black
  bands and duplicated screens. The single exception is a **co-attach joiner** (`seedPaint` →
  `create-screen`): tmux only repaints on SIGWINCH, so a joiner that did not resize never gets a
  redraw, and the screen captured server-side inside `create()` (`PtyCreateResult.screen`) is the
  only thing that paints it — see docs/team-presence.md. **A co-attach joiner also misses tmux's
  MOUSE-TRACKING modes** (`?1000h/?1002h/?1006h`): tmux emits them only at its OWN attach, and
  neither the `screen` capture (`capture-pane` carries no private modes) nor a SIGWINCH redraw
  re-sends them — so the joiner's wheel can't scroll tmux history until a keystroke makes the app
  re-request mouse. `join()` therefore sets `PtyCreateResult.coAttachMouse` for tmux-backed joins
  (gated on `persistKey`, on BOTH the screen and resize branches) and the renderer writes
  `CO_ATTACH_MOUSE_SEQ` into the fresh xterm (both `ModalTerminal` and `TerminalNode`). tmux is
  always `mouse on`, so this matches its invariant client state; the enable is idempotent. Was the
  "can't scroll the kanban card-modal terminal until you press a key" bug.

xterm's own `scrollback` (`xtermScrollback(settings.tmuxScrollback)`, floored at 1000, capped at
`XTERM_SCROLLBACK_MAX` = 10000) is kept for the sessions tmux does *not* back (a plain shell when
tmux is unavailable) and for the cold-snapshot replay — it is not what the user scrolls in a tmux
session.

## Terminal node lifecycle (gotchas)

`src/renderer/nodes/TerminalNode.tsx` is the trickiest file:

- The xterm instance + PTY session are created once in a `useEffect(…, [data.respawnNonce,
  offscreenEpoch])` and torn down on unmount. The component persists across re-renders because
  React Flow keys nodes by `id` — never change a node's id, or you'll respawn its terminal.
  **Third in-place state — "released" (2026-08-11, offscreen dispose):** a node fully offscreen
  in the canvas viewport for `settings.offscreenTerminalMinutes` (default 10, `0` = never;
  Settings → tmux) has its xterm + PTY client torn down IN PLACE — node stays mounted showing a
  plate, tmux session untouched — and revives (warm reattach) when it re-approaches the viewport.
  Pure policy: `terminal/offscreen-policy.ts`. Two load-bearing rules a refactor must not undo:
  (1) the **visibility IntersectionObserver lives in its own mount-stable `[termKey]` effect**,
  NOT the lifecycle effect — the down transition re-runs the lifecycle effect, and an observer
  owned there dies with it, making revive unreachable (permanent plate; caught in review). The
  lifecycle run publishes to it through refs (`visibilityReportRef`, `offscreenLiveRef`,
  identity-checked on clear). (2) The remote exclusion asks `offscreenCoreIsRemote(session.source)`
  (`'local'` only is eligible — relay/server tabs excluded), NOT `data.remote`, **a field nothing
  sets on node data** (a gate on it was constant false and type-invisible; pinned by tests).
  SSH-project nodes are also excluded; collapsed = hidden (same convention as the WebGL budget);
  a `respawnNonce` bump while released revives first. Agent-status/fan-out clears live in a
  dedicated unmount-only effect (a release or respawn must not blank a live badge).
- **React StrictMode is deliberately not used** (`main.tsx`) — double-mount would spawn
  two PTYs per node.
- The xterm container is `nodrag nowheel`; a transparent **hover-guard** overlay sits on top
  until you dwell `settings.panHoverDelay` (so quick drag = move node, scroll = pan). After
  the dwell the guard is removed and xterm takes input. The header stays draggable.
- A `ResizeObserver` drives `FitAddon.fit()` + `transport.resize`. Canvas zoom is a CSS
  transform, so it does *not* change `clientWidth` — cols/rows stay stable across zoom.
  `scale-fix.ts` patches xterm's mouse coords so text selection stays aligned when zoomed.

## Node kinds (all rendered by React Flow custom nodes)

- **terminal** (`TerminalNode.tsx`) — xterm + tmux (see above). Header: collapse, color,
  click-to-rename title, ✦ AI-name, ×. Body has a **hover guard** overlay: dwell
  `settings.panHoverDelay` (default 600 ms) before the terminal takes focus — before that,
  drag = move node, scroll = pan canvas. **Cmd/Ctrl+M** (while hovered) toggles a markdown
  render of the captured output. Tag chips via `NodeTags`.
  **Selection + copy is tmux's** (its mouse is on — see the tmux section): drag to select, wheel to
  scroll tmux's history. A drag copies via copy-mode, and tmux emits **OSC 52** to the client, whose
  handler writes the **system clipboard** — the one copy path on every platform *and* over SSH (no
  `pbcopy`). OSC 52 writes an app emits itself (vim `"+y`, gh, yazi) reach the clipboard through the
  same handler (write-only — a read query is refused). The emulator's own copy chords stay for a
  selection xterm *does* own (`copyKeyAction`/`isCopyShortcut`): **Cmd+C** (mac), **Ctrl+Shift+C**
  and **Ctrl+Insert** (Linux/Windows) — matched on `e.key` *or* the physical `KeyC`, so non-Latin
  layouts still copy. A copy chord is **always swallowed**, selection or not: letting Ctrl+Shift+C
  fall through would reach the pty as `\x03` (SIGINT). Ctrl+Insert exists because Chromium reserves
  Ctrl+Shift+C for the inspector and a page cannot `preventDefault()` it — which is where Server
  Edition users land. Plain **Ctrl+C** is never intercepted. To select in **xterm** instead of tmux
  (or inside an app that grabs the mouse, like vim/htop), hold **Option** (mac —
  xterm's `macOptionClickForcesSelection`) or **Shift** (Linux/Windows) while dragging.
  **Copying now says so**: the OSC 52 handler floats a transient `Copied N lines` pill over the
  terminal's BOTTOM-RIGHT corner (`.term-copy-pill`, the same class on the canvas node and the
  kanban card modal — one session seen twice must not speak in two voices; bottom-right because
  every agent CLI writes its input line bottom-left, and `pointer-events: none` because it sits on
  the terminal and fires on every copy), because tmux's `copy-pipe-and-cancel`
  clears the highlight at the exact instant it copies — which read as "the copy failed" to a user
  whose other pane ran claude. And a drag that produced NEITHER an OSC 52 nor an xterm selection
  means the pane's app captured the mouse (claude does, codex does not), so a one-time
  `Hold ⌥ to select text` hint fires instead (`nodeterm.seenSelectHint`). **The whole layer is
  OFF for an agent in `SELF_REPORTS_COPY` (`reportsOwnCopy` — claude, which prints its own
  "copied N chars to tmux buffer" line): a second message for one gesture is noise, and a claude
  terminal is byte-identical to before the feature. **One owner per pill:**
  the `copied` receipt is raised ONLY by the OSC 52 path, the hint ONLY by the drag path — the two
  never race for the same slot. The emulator's own copy **chord** (Cmd+C / Ctrl+Shift+C) deliberately
  raises nothing: Claude Code prints its own copy line ("copied N chars to tmux buffer"), and a
  second message for one gesture is noise. Decision logic is the pure `terminal/copy-feedback.ts`;
  `useCopyFeedback` is the glue (it also yields to a clipboard-failure `nodeterm:toast`, so the
  Server Edition never shows a green receipt beside a red banner), and the node publishes its sink
  through the module-level `copySubs` map because the OSC handler survives a park.
  **Shift+Enter** is remapped to `\x1b\r` (ESC+CR / M-Enter) so agent CLIs insert a newline
  instead of submitting (`terminalKeyAction` / `SHIFT_ENTER_SEQ` in `terminal-config.ts`; sent in
  all terminals — harmless in a plain shell). **Cmd (mac) / Ctrl+click** opens links in the
  output: URLs → default browser (`@xterm/addon-web-links`), file paths → editor node and
  directories → Explorer reveal (`terminal/file-links.ts`, existence-verified against the project
  fs via cached parent-dir listings, with `path:line[:col]` compiler-output suffixes). The path
  dialect follows the FILESYSTEM-OWNING CORE, not the viewer: desktop-local may use its own
  platform, Server Edition and relay tabs use the core's reported `process.platform`, and SSH
  projects are POSIX. A failed host-platform read disables file links for that connection — it
  never guesses from the browser. Standalone `ssh` terminal nodes remain URL-only because they
  have no remote fs API with which to verify a token; relay tabs do have a core-bound, jailed fs
  API and therefore support file links. Windows existence matching is case-insensitive and accepts
  both separators; UNC tokens are refused whole before they can be reinterpreted as cwd-relative.
- **Agent** (`createAgentNode(agentId, …)`) — a terminal preset that runs an agent CLI as its
  `initialCommand` (runs once on open via `transport.write`, then cleared), with `data.agentId`
  set. Builtins (`claude`/`codex`/`gemini`) come from `AGENT_CONFIG` (clay color etc.).
  Agent nodes get extra behavior **gated by the
  agent's capabilities** (see **Agent support** below): a busy/working badge + unread dot +
  completion notification + session-name chip (hook-capable agents), content search, and the
  Claude-only **Branch conversation** action. Custom user-defined agents spawn + show
  process/terminal-title status only.
- **sticky** (`StickyNode.tsx`) — colored note, free text, collapsible. Has link handles:
  connect a sticky to any terminal node to attach the note as context (see Context Link).
- **group** (`GroupNode.tsx`) — real React Flow parent/child frame, and frames **nest** (2026-08):
  a group may contain other groups to any depth. `groupSelectedNodes` wraps objects that share ONE
  container — frames included — creating the wrapper inside that container; a mixed-container set,
  or an ancestor selected together with its own descendant, is **refused** rather than scrambled
  (positions are only comparable within one container, and the descendant would be torn out of the
  ancestor being wrapped). Box-selection routinely catches both, so structural actions normalize
  the selection to its subtree roots first (`selectedRootIds`). `ungroupNodes` promotes a frame's
  direct children into **its own parent** (not to the root — that would move them by the whole
  ancestor offset); `reparentNode` moves a node OR a whole frame subtree, keeps its **root-space**
  position fixed (`rootPosition`, not the old add-one-parent's-origin math) and refuses a cycle;
  `addSelectionToGroup` adds a selection to an existing frame; `reorderGroupWithinParent` reorders
  a frame among its siblings, carrying its subtree. `nodeStatesToFlow`/`groupsFirst` emit frames
  **depth-first from the root** — a flat "groups first" sort is not enough once two groups compare
  equal — and that persisted order is also the downgrade contract (a pre-nesting build's stable
  sort leaves it alone, so a nested tree still hydrates parent-first and renders there).
  **A frame that gains a child bigger than itself is re-fitted, ancestors included**
  (`fitGroupToChildren` up the chain): a wrapper created at `(minX-28, minY-62)` relative to its
  parent is routinely negative, and `extent:'parent'` would make React Flow clamp it into an
  inverted range — snapping the frame hundreds of px away and dragging the whole wrapped subtree
  with it. Visually: a dashed rounded frame in the group color with a floating label pill (color
  dot + editable name) on the top border and ungroup/× top-right (on hover/selected). **The pill
  is the frame's `dragHandle`** and the frame body is `pointer-events: none` — a frame is a
  background container, not a giant drag target, so its body passes clicks to the pane and an
  outer frame cannot swallow the clicks meant for a frame drawn inside it. The
  `NodeResizer` line is hidden (`lineStyle` transparent) so it can't draw a sharp-cornered
  box; the selection ring is a `box-shadow` instead, which follows the same `border-radius`.
- **editor** (`EditorNode.tsx`) — Monaco code editor for a `filePath`; reads/writes via
  `fs:read`/`fs:write`, auto-detects language from the path, ⌘S saves, dirty dot. A
  **Preview / Edit** toggle (or ⌘M while hovered) renders the live content as markdown.
  **Image files** (png/jpg/gif/webp/bmp/ico/svg/avif) skip Monaco and show an `<img>`
  preview instead — read as base64 via `fs:read-binary` into a `data:` URL (CSP allows
  `img-src data:`), on a checkerboard backdrop with the pixel dimensions in the header.
- **diff** (`DiffNode.tsx`) — Monaco diff editor; `diffStaged` chooses HEAD↔index (staged)
  vs index↔working (unstaged) via `git:show-file` + `fs:read`. Read-only.
- **video** (`VideoNode.tsx`) — a video player; a local file is served over the `nt-media://`
  protocol (allowlisted on mount via `media.allow`) with native controls; an SSH-project file
  (`data.sshFs`) is first pulled into the local media cache over the project's ControlMaster
  (`media.allowSsh`) then played the same way.
- **web** (`WebNode.tsx`) — an Electron `<webview>` (locked down, no `nodeintegration`) that loads
  a live `data.url`, or serves local html at `data.filePath` over `nt-media://`.
- **browser** (`BrowserNode.tsx`) — a navigable Chromium browser wrapping the shared
  `BrowserSurface` (webview + toolbar); the last top-level URL persists to `data.url`, and the same
  surface backs the kanban card modal's browser popup.
- **dino** (`DinoNode.tsx`) — a small self-contained T-Rex-style runner on a canvas (no PTY);
  high score persists via `data.highScore`.
- **subagent** / **loop** (`SubagentNode.tsx` / `LoopNode.tsx`) — render-only, hook-driven viz
  nodes, **never persisted**. `subagent` visualizes a subagent the Claude session spawned (type +
  task + live timer, expand for its live transcript — subagents have no PTY); `loop` shows a
  loop/schedule/cron kind + task + per-iteration summaries, Play re-issues the task into the parent
  terminal's tmux session.
- **chat** — **REMOVED 2026-07.** The SDK-driven Claude chat node (`ChatNode.tsx`, `main/chat-driver.ts`,
  the `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` dependency, and the whole chat-events/chatSessions stack) is
  gone — dropping the bundled SDK also removed a ~240 MB native binary per platform. A persisted `chat`
  node is migrated by `nodeStatesToFlow` into a **sticky tombstone** in place, carrying a
  `claude --resume <chatSessionId>` hint so the conversation continues in any terminal (a chat was an
  ordinary resumable Claude session). `CHAT_CAPABLE` / `canChat` survive but now gate **only** the
  ⌘M **ChatPanel** transcript view on a Claude *terminal* node (see the terminal bullet's Cmd/Ctrl+M),
  not any SDK chat node.

**Node resize is a HIT-AREA problem, not a clipping one** (2026-08-28, measured via CDP
`elementFromPoint` sweeps — do not re-derive this from reading CSS, it is counter-intuitive twice
over). `NodeResizer`'s controls are a 1px edge line and a 5px corner dot, and canvas zoom scales
both DOWN. Two independent defects; fixing either alone changes nothing a user can feel:
- **Width** — widened hit-only by `.react-flow__resize-control ::after` boxes in `styles.css`
  (8px out / 4px in, outward-biased). Visuals are untouched: hit-testing credits a pseudo-element's
  box to the element that owns the drag listener, so GroupNode's transparent `lineStyle` still
  renders as nothing.
- **Stacking** — the controls ship `z-index: auto`, and `.term-node` is **`position: static`**, so
  every overlay inside it (`.term-hover-guard` z 2 covering the whole body, offscreen plate 3,
  closed plate 4) competes in the SAME stacking context and wins. The inward half of any widening
  is dead until the controls are raised (now `z-index: 5` — deliberately below the bridge/link
  handles at 20 and the upload overlay at 30, which must stay grabbable).
- **…but NEVER on a group frame** (`:not(.react-flow__node-group)`, consort finding, MEASURED). A
  frame has none of those inner overlays, so it never needed the raise — and the raise breaks it
  outright: `.group-node__label` / `.group-node__actions` are `top: 0` + `translateY(-50%)`, i.e.
  centred ON the top border at `z-index: auto`, so a raised top-edge control covered the pill and
  the rename input, colour dot, Ungroup, Close **and the pill itself (the frame's `dragHandle`)**
  all hit-tested to the resize line the moment the frame was selected. Left at `auto` they win on
  DOM order, since GroupNode renders the resizer before them. **Any future raise of a node-level
  control owes the same question: what sits ON the border of a frame?**

The **visible** half is the other half of the same feature (Siim, 2026-08-28: "bolder frame around
agent windows to better handle resizing"): `.term-node`'s border is **2px**, not a 1px hairline that
reads as decoration rather than as something grabbable, and hovering a grab zone tints it accent at
20% so the widened band is discoverable instead of being an invisible 11px you must already know
about. A wider hit zone nobody can see is still guesswork — ship the two together. Thickening the
border is bounded only because `* { box-sizing: border-box }` is global: the node does not GROW, the
content box shrinks by 1px per thickened side instead. That is **not** the same as "no reflow" — a
terminal near a cell boundary can lose a column or row on the upgrade render, which the
ResizeObserver reports to the pty as an ordinary resize. One re-fit per node, once.

The static-position fact also kills the obvious wrong theory: `.term-node` is `overflow: hidden`,
but an overflow clip only applies to descendants whose CONTAINING BLOCK is inside it — the controls
are positioned against `.react-flow__node`, an ancestor — so they were never clipped, and moving
`<NodeResizer>` out of the root is a pure no-op. **Known remaining dead spot:** the bridge/link
handles are 13×13 at the vertical centre of the left and right edges, so resize is unreachable
there by design; the rest of each edge is a ~12px band.

Monaco is wired in `renderer/editor/monaco-setup.ts` (language workers bundled via Vite
`?worker` — no CDN; CSP `worker-src` allows them). Markdown rendering is shared in
`renderer/lib/markdown.ts` (`marked` + DOMPurify sanitize).

### Webview keep-alive across project switches (browser/web nodes)

Issue #301: a project switch used to reload every browser node's page — SPA state, forms, scroll,
websockets gone — because the load effect swaps the whole React Flow node array and an Electron
`<webview>`'s guest process dies on DOM detach (a webview cannot be parked like xterm). The fix
keeps the ELEMENT mounted instead of trying to preserve anything through a remount. The facts it
rests on are measured (Electron 42.x probes + in-app verification, 2026-08-26):

- A guest **survives** sibling insert/remove around its element (React reconciliation of kept,
  order-stable keyed children never touches them), and **survives `display:none`** of itself or an
  ancestor — state intact, viewport size and scroll kept (the guest is NOT resized to 0), repaint
  pixel-identical on reveal, timers running throttled like a background tab.
- A guest **dies** on any DOM *move* (`insertBefore`/`appendChild` of an attached element detaches
  first), taking a full page reload with it. React moves a kept child exactly when its RELATIVE
  ORDER among kept children changes (`lastPlacedIndex`), and React Flow renders nodes in
  prop-array order keyed by id (`adoptUserNodes` rebuilds `nodeLookup` in array order) — so the
  merged prop's order discipline IS the feature.

Mechanics (`renderer/lib/webviewKeepAlive.ts` pure + tested, `state/webviewKeepAlive.ts` store,
merged in Canvas exactly like the ephemeral subagent cards — Canvas state, persistence, undo and
the wire never see any of it):

- Every webview-hosting node (`browser`/`web`) renders in ONE stable **pool region** at the tail
  of the `<ReactFlow>` nodes prop, ordered by the pool's entries; entry order never changes while
  an entry lives (append/remove only — `webviewKeepAlive.test.ts` pins the order-stability
  invariant, `webview-keepalive-reconcile.test.tsx` pins the no-detach consequence against real
  React). Visible cost of the hoist: an unselected browser/web node paints above other unselected
  z-0 nodes it overlaps (selection's z 1000 still wins).
- On switch-away the outgoing project's pages become **ghosts**: same node id, `display:none`,
  non-interactive, parked at the origin, `data.ghost` telling the surfaces to route facts at the
  pool (`updateGhostData`) instead of `updateNodeData`. On return the SAME element goes live
  again; `overlayKeepAliveData` folds ghost-time navigations into the loaded nodes inside the one
  `setNodes`, so the `url` prop never moves under the surviving surface (which would navigate it).
- **The merge is keyed on the MOUNTED project (`keepAliveFromRef`), never `activeProjectId`, and a
  mounted entry whose node is missing falls back to its ghost.** Both exist because the pool store
  (zustand/useSyncExternalStore), the ref and `setNodes` do not land in one commit: a switch renders
  interleavings where the id would otherwise drop out of the merged list for one commit — and one
  absent commit is an unmount, i.e. a dead guest ([MEASURED]: the ghost→live direction remounted
  every returning page until the fallback; live→ghost never did). A genuinely deleted node's entry
  is dropped at the deletion funnels (handleNodesChange's `remove`, `deleteNodes`, the peer-mutation
  remove, project deletion/prune), with the next retire as backstop — never by the merge.
- **Memory bounds** (same posture as park/WebGL: a lever must not end live work): a ghost is
  hidden, so the existing Browser Memory Saver discards its guest after `BROWSER_DISCARD_MS`
  unless loading/audible/agent-driven — `onGuestDiscarded` then drops the entry (a husk would hold
  a cap slot). `BACKGROUND_WEBVIEW_MAX` (8) hard-caps live background guests, evicting
  longest-retired first; `activateProject` runs BEFORE `retireProject` on every switch so a
  returning page sheds its background clock before that eviction can pick it.
- E2E-verified under Xvfb (CDP): same webContents across Alpha→Beta→Alpha, typed form text + JS
  state + tick counter continuous, zero reloads; wrapper + webview DOM elements identity-stable in
  both directions. Server Edition: inert (no `<webview>` in a plain browser — ghosts are empty
  husks, nothing to preserve). Mobile: N/A (no canvas).

## Agent support (Claude / Codex / Gemini / Copilot / opencode / Grok / custom)

The app is a pluggable multi-agent system: Claude Code is one builtin of
several. Extra terminal-node behavior is driven per agent by a registry + capability lists, a
shared 4-state model, and a **transient** zustand store `state/agentStatus.ts`
(`{state, agentId, unread, session, sessionId, loop, hibernated}` per node id; the live `state` is
**not** persisted — only `unread`/`session`/`sessionId`/`agentId`/`loop`/`hibernated` go to
localStorage under `nodeterm.agentStatus`, migrated once from the legacy `nodeterm.claudeStatus`
key. `agentId` is durable because a hand-launched `claude` in a plain terminal is known nowhere
else, and its context links must keep classifying across restarts).

- **Agent registry + capabilities** — `src/shared/agents/config.ts` holds `AGENT_CONFIG`
  (claude/codex/gemini/copilot/opencode/grok: id, label, spawn command, color, `promptInjectionMode`, …) keyed
  by an **open** `AgentId`
  type (so custom ids fit). Capabilities are membership lists, not flags:
  `AGENT_HOOK_TARGETS`, `RESUMABLE_AGENTS`, `SUBAGENT_CAPABLE`, `RECURRING_CAPABLE`,
  `BRANCH_CAPABLE`, `CONTEXT_LINK_CAPABLE`, `USAGE_CAPABLE`, `CHAT_CAPABLE`,
  `TRANSFER_SOURCE_CAPABLE`, `RENAME_CAPABLE`, `TITLE_READ_CAPABLE`, `CANVAS_CONTROL_CAPABLE`,
  `PERMISSION_MODE_CAPABLE`, `MODEL_SWITCH_CAPABLE`, with helpers (`hasHooks`,
  `canBranch`, `canContextLink`, `canChat`, `canRename`, `canReadTitle`, `hasPermissionMode`, …).
  Branch and the ⌘M **ChatPanel** transcript view (`CHAT_CAPABLE` / `canChat` — since the SDK chat
  node was removed, 2026-07, this is all `canChat` now gates) stay **Claude-only** purely by
  being in only `BRANCH_CAPABLE` / `CHAT_CAPABLE`. The other lists span more agents, and the
  memberships below are the ones to check before assuming "claude-only" (all verified against
  `config.ts`, 2026-08-09): the per-node **context meter** is `USAGE_CAPABLE = claude/codex/gemini`;
  the **permission mode** is `PERMISSION_MODE_CAPABLE = claude/grok/gemini/codex`; the session-name
  sync is **split in two** — `TITLE_READ_CAPABLE = claude/codex/grok/gemini` (read) ⊇
  `RENAME_CAPABLE = claude/grok` (write), because gemini and codex name their own sessions but have
  no rename command (codex's read leg is `readCodexSessionName`);
  **Context Link** spans four builtins
  (`CONTEXT_LINK_CAPABLE = claude/codex/gemini/opencode`, NOT grok/copilot). UI gates
  on these helpers — no hardcoded `=== 'claude'`. **Custom agents** (user-defined in Settings,
  `customAgents`) inherit the declared `baseAgent` harness through `capabilityAgentId`; a custom
  agent with no base remains spawn + terminal-title + process status only. Per-agent write-ups:
  **`docs/grok-agent.md`**, **`docs/gemini-agent.md`**, **`docs/copilot-agent.md`** (there is none for codex — its approval mapping
  and every value's reasoning live in `src/shared/agents/approval-mode.ts`);
  the distilled rules are **Adding a new agent** at the end of this section.
- **Model gateway / switcher** — `settings.modelGateway` stores one gateway root + a NON-SECRET
  credential reference: `${env:VAR}` for environment mode or
  `${secret:model-gateway-api-key}` for a literal held by `ModelGatewayCredentialService`. Desktop
  literal keys reuse the GitHub token store's safeStorage encryption / 0600 fallback; Server
  Edition uses the same generic 0600 atomic store. Legacy plaintext settings migrate only after
  the secret write succeeds. `shared/agents/model-gateway.ts` is the ONE mapping from a base
  harness to derived routes, env vars, compatible models and safely quoted model flags. Env
  expansion reuses `shared/agents/expansion.ts` and happens only in core against the host process
  environment; an unset reference fails closed instead of sending a token or partial credential.
  Discovery at `/v1/models` is the **OpenAI Models API convention**, implemented by both LiteLLM
  and Bifrost; the current `/openai/v1` + `/anthropic` launch-route derivation is Bifrost's layout,
  not the source of the discovery convention. Discovery sends the standard bearer header plus
  Bifrost's `x-bf-vk` header (needed by legacy, non-`sk-bf-` virtual keys), and runs in core
  (`agent:discover-models`) so browser CORS cannot block the Server Edition and the key never
  enters a terminal command. Support is a
  capability (`MODEL_SWITCH_CAPABLE = claude/codex/copilot`) resolved through `capabilityAgentId`, so a
  custom agent with a supported `baseAgent` inherits it automatically — the settings UI and canvas
  menu carry no agent allowlist. A model switch SIGTERMs the pane's foreground non-shell process
  group (never types `/exit`) and RECYCLES the tmux session before cold-resume: an existing shell may
  predate the gateway setting, and tmux env changes do not retroactively change that shell's
  environment. Recreating it guarantees the current URL/key applies without typing a secret into
  the pane. Ordinary Restart stays in-place. Custom-agent env is still merged last and may override
  the shared mapping. Desktop and Server Edition use the same core handler; relay tabs deliberately
  do not apply this machine's gateway to another core. Mobile needs a settings/model-picker surface
  before it can expose the feature.
- **Grok** (`@xai-official/grok` 1.0.0, builtin since 2026-08) — in `AGENT_HOOK_TARGETS`,
  `RESUMABLE_AGENTS`, `RENAME_CAPABLE`, `PERMISSION_MODE_CAPABLE` and `CANVAS_CONTROL_CAPABLE`; NOT in
  `USAGE_CAPABLE` / `CONTEXT_LINK_CAPABLE` / `SUBAGENT_CAPABLE` (each blocked on a fixture that needs a
  logged-in grok session — the context meter, context links and subagent cards are **not implemented**
  for grok). Its hook config is a **directory** (`$GROK_HOME/hooks/*.json`, all merged), so nodeterm
  **owns one file outright** (`nodeterm-status.json`) instead of merging into a shared settings file —
  which is also why a malformed copy of it is *healed* rather than preserved, locally and on an SSH
  host (`RemoteHooks.installGrokRemote`, under the host's own `$GROK_HOME`). Its dialect is
  **camelCase keys with snake_case event VALUES** (`{"hookEventName":"pre_tool_use"}`) — the SDK path
  flips the keys to snake_case, so `normalizeGrok` canonicalizes the event name and reads every field
  twice, and the shells share one decoder (`grokRawFields`). It carries **no `transcript_path`**, so a
  session directory is DERIVED from `cwd` + `sessionId` (`core/agents/grok-paths.ts`, the one
  `$GROK_HOME` rule — `core/usage/grok-usage.ts` delegates to it) and remembered in the shells' raw
  listener; the name read is `core/grok-session.ts` over `summary.json`, routed per agent by
  `core/agent-session-name.ts`. **The tool-event `matcher` is a regex: `.*`, never `*`** — a bare `*`
  is invalid and silently stops tool events firing (hence `ManagedHookEvent`). Grok also reads
  **`~/.claude/skills`** (Claude compat), which is why canvas control needed no new installer, and
  **`~/.claude/settings.json`**, so every grok event ALSO fires nodeterm's claude hook — an **inert**
  cross-fire (`normalizeClaude` finds neither grok's camelCase keys nor, in the SDK dialect, its
  lowercase event values), pinned by tests; canonicalizing claude's event-name compare would make it
  harmful. The `auto` permission-mode **version gate is claude's alone** (it is fed by a `claude
  --version` probe), and grok's mode flag must go **BEFORE** its `--` separator, which is
  end-of-options. Full picture, dialect traps and the device checklist: **`docs/grok-agent.md`**.
- **Gemini + codex parity** (2026-08-09) — brought both up to grok's level in the lists above. Unlike
  grok, **both CLIs are installed** and gemini **ships its own hook reference**
  (`/usr/lib/node_modules/@google/gemini-cli/bundle/docs/hooks/reference.md`), so almost every fact is
  measured. The load-bearing ones:
  - **Gemini's envelope IS claude-shaped** — `session_id`/`transcript_path`/`cwd`/`hook_event_name`
    (`reference.md:46-58`), the exact opposite of grok's missing `transcript_path`, so the shells just
    jail the path they are handed. The **event names** are gemini's own: eleven exist, `GEMINI_HOOK_EVENTS`
    subscribes **seven**. `AfterModel` is excluded because it fires **per streamed chunk**
    (`reference.md:236`) = one hook process per chunk; `BeforeModel` is **not** per-chunk (it fires once
    per request) and is excluded only because it reports nothing we render.
  - **`Notification` → `blocked`, matched as a CLOSED set** (`notification_type === 'ToolPermission'`).
    Before this, a gemini node sat on RUNNING while it waited for a permission answer. The closed match
    is measured, not cautious: gemini's `NotificationType` enum has exactly ONE member, and it fires
    only after `shouldConfirmExecute` returns details — i.e. only for a real dialog, so an
    auto-approved/`yolo` call fires nothing. **Grok's `includes('permission')` strobed on every tool
    call**; widening this "to be safe" is the unsafe direction.
  - **Context meter from each agent's own transcript** — one tail per agent, each with its own `parse`
    dep on `createContextTail` (`core/gemini-session.ts`, `core/codex-session.ts`), in **both** shells.
    Gemini: `tokens.input` and a window from `geminiWindowFor`, which mirrors the CLI's own
    `tokenLimit()` — a **family rule with a 1M catch-all default**, so an unknown model gets the right
    answer instead of a confident wrong denominator. Codex: `last_token_usage.input_tokens` and its own
    stated `model_context_window`. Two traps: `total_token_usage` is **CUMULATIVE** (would render a
    13%-full session at 79%), and `cached` is **INSIDE** `input` for both — while claude's input
    *excludes* cache reads, which is why claude sums them. **The formulas must not be unified.**
    The transcript jail is widened **per root** (`~/.gemini/tmp`, `<codexHome>/sessions`), never to
    `$HOME` — that predicate exists so a forged hook POST cannot aim a read at `~/.ssh/id_rsa`.
  - **`hasUsage` gated THREE features, not one.** Joining `USAGE_CAPABLE` also switched on
    `context.ensure` and the find bar's transcript index, both of which go through claude's
    `resolveTranscript` — whose **cwd fallback** then handed a codex node *the newest claude transcript
    for that cwd*: a stranger's session as its meter and its search hits. Now gated by the pure
    `readsClaudeTranscript` (`renderer/lib/transcriptGates.ts`), which reuses `CHAT_CAPABLE` rather than
    adding a fourth list. Non-claude agents lose only the mount-time head start.
  - **`TITLE_READ_CAPABLE` was created here**: gemini names its own sessions through its `update_topic`
    tool (the title is in that call's `args.title`, NOT a top-level field) but has no rename command, so
    the read and write legs split. Its read path is the transcript the context tail already tracks
    (injected as `AgentSessionNameDeps.geminiPathFor`, held in a `let` in `src/main/index.ts` to avoid a
    TDZ throw that would kill a node's whole poll chain).
  - **In-place restart** works for gemini: `EXIT_SEQUENCES.gemini = '/quit'` — and it must stay **bare**,
    because `/quit --delete` exits *and permanently deletes* the session history, i.e. exactly what the
    restart exists to resume (pinned by its own test).
  Full picture, measurements, gaps and a device checklist: **`docs/gemini-agent.md`**.
- **Permission mode** (agents in `PERMISSION_MODE_CAPABLE` — claude, grok, **gemini**, **codex**) —
  the mode a session **starts** in (`claude --permission-mode <mode>`; Shift+Tab still cycles it at
  runtime). Membership no longer implies claude's flag spelling: **the per-agent translation lives in
  `src/shared/agents/approval-mode.ts`** (`approvalFlags` / `modeSupported`), which is also where
  `withPermissionMode` now lives — it moved one layer up out of `config.ts` to break a cycle.
  gemini = `--approval-mode default|auto_edit|yolo|plan`, codex = `--ask-for-approval
  untrusted|on-request|never`. Two rules the mapping exists to enforce: a mode the CLI **cannot
  express emits NO flag**, never a substituted nearest match (codex has no `plan` and no
  edit-specific mode; **gemini has no `auto`** — nothing in its vocabulary means "approve most things
  but not edits", and since `auto` is the DEFAULT mode, mapping it to `auto_edit` would have switched
  auto-approve-edits on for every existing gemini node at upgrade time, silently), and "supports"
  must not be a lie either — codex's `manual` maps to
  `untrusted` because its built-in default is `OnRequest` (measured: `codex doctor`, no `approval`
  key in `~/.codex/config.toml`), so leaving it unflagged would deliver "the model decides when to
  ask" under an "Ask each time" label. **codex is the first agent where `manual` emits a flag.** The
  UI copy is DERIVED from the mapping (`permissionModeAgentIds` / `permissionModeAgentsLabel` /
  `unsupportedModesNote` / `bypassSandboxCaveat`) so a sentence cannot drift from what the table
  does — so the note now reads "Auto has no Gemini equivalent…" beside codex's two gaps, and the
  residual wart is only that `auto` and `manual` land on the same gemini policy (the *prompting* one).
  `--sandbox` is a separate axis and deliberately untouched (`--ask-for-approval never`
  still sandboxes).
  `settings.claudePermissionMode` (global, default **`auto`** — a behavior change for existing
  users, who previously got a prompt per action) is overridden per project by
  `project.defaultPermissionMode` (persisted to `.nodeterm/project.json`, so a `bypassPermissions`
  override travels to everyone who clones the repo — the tab menu warns). Modes are
  `manual | auto | acceptEdits | plan | bypassPermissions`, labelled once in
  `PERMISSION_MODE_LABELS` (from which `ALL_PERMISSION_MODES` is derived — the dropdown and the
  validator can't desync). `resolvePermissionMode(project, settings)` is the resolver
  (`renderer/state/permissionMode.ts` `activePermissionMode(agentId)` binds it to the live stores **and
  applies the version gate below — for `agentId === 'claude'` only**), and
  **`withPermissionMode(cmd, agentId, mode)` is the single
  funnel through which every agent-node launch site appends the flag** (new node, cold-restore
  resume, Branch, handoff/transfer, explain-commit, add-agent, canvas-control open-agent + team
  spawn). **WHERE the flag lands is decided at the composed layer** (`createAgentNode`), not in
  `withPermissionMode`: with no `argvPromptSeparator` (claude) it goes LAST, keeping the historical
  command byte-identical; with one (grok's `--`) it must go **BEFORE** the separator, because `--` is
  end-of-options and a flag after it is a positional — silently swallowed into the prompt or a clap
  usage error. Assert that at `createAgentNode`; a `withPermissionMode` test passes while the composed
  line is wrong. (gemini and codex declare no separator, so their flag goes last and their command
  lines stay byte-identical; grok is still the only agent taking the other branch.)
  UI: Settings → Agents, and the tab ⌄ menu for the per-project override.
  **Version gate (`auto` only) — CLAUDE's alone:** `--permission-mode auto` exists only in **Claude Code ≥ 2.1.71**;
  older CLIs validate the value against their own choices list and **exit 1** — and `auto` is the
  default, so an ungated flag would kill every Claude launch on an older CLI. So the CLI is probed
  (`core/claude-cli.ts` → `claude --version`, memoized, registered on `CorePlatform` so **both**
  shells serve it; reached from the renderer via `window.nodeTerminal.claude.cliCaps()`, with a
  **real** ws-bridge implementation) and `gatePermissionMode(mode, autoSupported)` degrades **only
  `auto`**, and only to `manual` = **no flag** = the bare pre-feature command. Everything **fails
  open**: unknown/unreadable version, a probe that failed or hasn't answered yet ⇒ bare command,
  never a blocked launch; the other four modes are never touched by the gate, and the user's
  *setting* stays `auto` (only the emitted command line changes). **SSH projects** are gated on the
  **remote** host's CLI, never the local one: `SshProjectManager.connect` probes `claude --version`
  on the host (through a login shell — an ssh exec channel's rc file usually bails out early — with
  `$HOME/.local/bin` + `$HOME/.claude/local` prepended to PATH: the official installer targets
  `~/.local/bin`, which a stock root `.profile` never adds, so a host whose interactive shells run
  claude fine still probed "not found" and silently degraded `auto` to manual) and
  caches the answer on the connection → `useSshConn`; not connected / not yet probed ⇒ no `auto`
  flag. A FAILED remote probe (claude not found — often a transient login-shell hiccup) **retries
  on a bounded backoff** (`PROBE_RETRY_DELAYS_MS`; every attempt pushes its answer immediately so
  launch waiters never block on the retry tail; a definite version — old or new — never retries),
  and the status event carries `remoteClaudeVersion` (`null` = probe failed) beside the boolean.
  The cold-restore relaunch `await`s the (shell-warmed) local probe because it fires on mount —
  and on an SSH project whose resolved mode is `auto` it also waits (`SSH_AUTO_PROBE_WAIT_MS`,
  bounded, fail-open) for the REMOTE probe's first answer, which races the same mount. Because
  the degrade is silent by design, the tab menu's Auto rows surface it: `sshAutoModeHint`
  (tri-state `useSshConn.autoPermAnswer` + probed version) puts a ⚠︎ + tooltip on "Auto" / "Use
  global (Auto)" for an SSH project whose remote CLI is too old / missing / not yet probed.
  **Security:** mode values come from hand-editable, git-shared JSON and end up interpolated into
  a shell command line (tmux `send-keys`), so `permissionModeFlag` **re-validates** the mode at the
  interpolation site (the type is compile-time only) — an unrecognized mode yields **no flag**, i.e.
  the bare, safe command. `'manual'` likewise yields no flag, reproducing the pre-feature command
  bit-for-bit. The setting and the per-project override apply to **terminal (CLI) agent nodes only**
  (the SDK **chat node**, which never honored it, was removed 2026-07). **No other agent inherits this
  gate:** grok has accepted every mode since 1.0.0 and gemini/codex accept theirs on the versions we
  measured, so gating any of them on a `claude --version` probe would
  downgrade their sessions on a machine whose claude is old or absent — `activePermissionMode` gates
  only `'claude'`, `ensureActivePermissionMode` awaits the probes only for `'claude'`, and
  `sshAutoModeHint`'s copy names Claude in every sentence for the same reason. An agent needing its
  own gate adds one beside claude's.
- **State via each agent's hooks → shared 4-state model** — detection uses the agent's own
  hooks, **not** output parsing. `src/shared/agents/normalize.ts` has per-agent normalizers
  (`normalizeClaude`/`normalizeCodex`/`normalizeGemini`/`normalizeCopilot`/`normalizeOpencode`/`normalizeGrok`) that map each agent's native hook
  events to a `NormalizedAgentEvent` over the shared `AgentState` (`working | waiting | blocked
  | done`) plus subagent/recurring/session kinds. Canvas's listener consumes
  `NormalizedAgentEvent` from `agent:status`, drives the `agentStatus` store, fires throttled
  (5s/node) background notifications, and records the session id. Header shows a pulsing
  **RUNNING** (working) / **NEEDS YOU** (waiting/blocked) badge.
- **Hook server (loopback HTTP)** — `src/core/agents/hook-server.ts` is a main-process
  loopback HTTP server (per-session bearer token, fail-open) that the installed hook scripts
  POST to; it replaced the old `fs.watch` signal-log mechanism. `buildPtyEnv` injects the
  node id + endpoint/token into each spawned session's env; because tmux sessions **outlive
  the app**, the server also writes `<userData>/hook-endpoint.env` so a relaunched main
  process re-advertises the same endpoint (restart handoff). A `setRawListener` channel feeds
  the per-node context-window meter (`context-tail.ts` — **one tail per agent**, each with its own
  `parse` dep: claude's usage records, `codexContextParse`, `geminiContextParse`) and the subagent
  live-transcript (`subagent-tail.ts`, claude only). The same events feed the **agent-status mirror**
  (`core/agent-status-mirror.ts`) the mobile companion reads; the mirror carries an optional
  `settings` block (`claudePermissionMode`/`autoSupported`/`claudeAccounts`) so the phone can
  launch agents with the desktop's permission mode + managed accounts, and SSH slices get their
  **per-host** settings (remote CLI caps + host-matched accounts) injected via
  `remote-status-push`'s `settingsFor` dep.
- **Hook installers** — `src/core/agents/hooks/` holds per-agent hook services + an installer
  registry `MANAGED_HOOK_INSTALLERS`. `managed-script.ts` builds the POSIX hook script that
  POSTs to the server (env-gated: a no-op in the user's normal terminals, active only in
  sessions nodeterm spawns; the `claude-signals` string is kept as the idempotency marker that
  migrates users off the old hook). claude → `~/.claude/settings.json` and gemini →
  `~/.gemini/settings.json` (shared `install-helper.ts`, merged/idempotent, preserving other
  tools' hooks); codex → `~/.codex/hooks.json` + `~/.codex/config.toml` trust entries
  (`codex-trust.ts` — the hash gates whether codex runs the hook); **grok → our OWN file
  `$GROK_HOME/hooks/nodeterm-status.json`** (its hook config is a directory whose files are all
  merged, so there is nothing of the user's inside ours — which is also why a malformed copy is
  *healed*, not preserved, on both the local and the SSH path). The per-event **`matcher`** the grok
  installer needs is why events are typed `ManagedHookEvent` (`string | {event, matcher}`): grok's
  tool matcher is a REGEX and must be `.*` — a bare `*` is invalid and silently stops tool events
  firing. Plain-string events keep their byte-identical output for every other agent.
- **Per-node hook identity** (`src/core/agents/node-auth-*.ts`, `node-token-*.ts`,
  `node-identity-policy.ts` — full write-up in **`docs/node-identity.md`**) — the shared bearer proves
  "a session on this machine", never *which* session, so every node also gets a capability derived
  from one restart-stable secret (`kid.mac`, domain-separated HMAC over the node id), handed to the
  client as a 0600 file and verified three ways: `verified` / `legacy` / `forged`. `legacy` is "we
  cannot judge this", not a failure. Two invariants come out of this series and both cost real
  incidents to learn:
  - **A credential never rides argv — local or SSH.** Measured 2026-08-13: `buildPtyEnv` put the hook
    bearer in the tmux `-e` argv, which lands in a long-lived tmux client's `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`
    at **mode 444** on a stock Linux with no `hidepid`; combined with `open-terminal --cmd` not being
    in the confirm-gated `DESTRUCTIVE` set, that was arbitrary command execution as the victim from
    any account on the box. A remote command line is argv on **both** ends, so the same rule binds
    every `ssh`/`curl` we generate. Credentials travel by 0600 file or by **stdin**
    (`curl --config -`, already house style in `usage/remote-claude-usage.ts` and
    `codex-identity-proxy.ts`). Never add an argv fallback "for old curl" — that undoes the fix.
  - **Both raw listeners change together** — `src/main/index.ts` and `src/server/agent-status.ts`.
    A new field on the hook event (the `verified` flag was one) that reaches only the desktop leaves
    the Server Edition silently without the feature; the boundary tests cannot tell you a field is
    *missing*. `hook-verified-parity.test.ts` asserts it at source level because this repo has
    shipped a one-shell hook-server change three times.
  - **Every generated sh client reads the token through ONE resolver** (`nt_read_node_token`,
    `core/agents/node-token-sh.ts`) — the managed hook script, `nodeterm.sh` and `context.sh`. The
    token dir is advertised only by the endpoint FILE, and a session is pinned for life to the
    endpoint PATH it got at tmux creation, so a client that reads only what that file advertises
    presents nothing forever when the file is pre-v2 (SSH hosts' shared `~/.nodeterm/hook-
    endpoint.env`, whose per-project socket path is re-bound on every connect, so it stays LIVE) or
    unreadable (a phone-spawned session). Issue #384: the hook script FAILS OVER and re-reads the
    token from the endpoint it adopts, the two shims did neither — so the same node proved itself
    through one client and was refused through the other by the trust-on-first-proof latch, for the
    life of the session. The resolver falls back to `<dir of the endpoint file>/node-tokens` (the
    layout by construction on all three surfaces) and then the well-known data dirs; it is monotone
    — advertised dir first, keyed by node-id filename in every candidate, and a foreign instance's
    dir yields a foreign `kid` = `legacy` = exactly what presenting nothing already gave.
  - **Every generated sh client walks the SAME endpoint failover** (`nt_candidates`/`nt_adopt`,
    `core/agents/hook-endpoint-failover-sh.ts`) — issue #445, the endpoint-level twin of #384: a
    session is pinned for life to the endpoint PATH it got at tmux creation, so an app
    quit/restart (or a retired project id) leaves it POSTing at a dead port while a live endpoint
    file sits right next to it. The managed hook script had the bounded candidate walk (locals
    before tunnels, `nt_fallback_max` 3, token re-read from the ADOPTED endpoint's dir); the two
    shims did not, so hook events healed themselves while every canvas-control verb died with
    "control endpoint unreachable" — in the field, a reviewer launch silently dropped. Now shared,
    one definition. Two server-side halves in `hook-server.ts`: a FAILED `listen()` un-wedges the
    singleton (it used to leave `this.server` set, making every retry a silent no-op at port 0)
    and both `stop()` and the failed-start path delete `hook-endpoint.env` — publication reflects
    listener liveness; a crash skips that, which is exactly what the client walk exists for. An
    HTTP answer of any code is authoritative: only a dead transport (curl 000/'') fails over, so a
    403/400 is never re-sent to another instance. The walk is skipped under
    `CODEX_SANDBOX_NETWORK_DISABLED` (#367 — the sandbox denies every connect, the hint is the
    right diagnosis) and the final error now distinguishes "no endpoint anywhere" from "an
    advertised endpoint that is not listening" (`STALE_ENDPOINT_HINT`). Desktop quit calls
    `hookServer.stop()` on the second before-quit pass, after the flush window.

  Enforcement is dated (`NODE_IDENTITY_STRICT_AFTER`, 2026-10-13, read through `isStrictInstant` so a
  clock years ahead cannot enter strict mode early) with a `settings.hookIdentityStrict` escape hatch
  in Settings → Agents. **Trust on first proof latches a node the moment it authenticates, so it
  refuses TODAY, not on the cutoff** — which is why every token sweep must also call
  `hookServer.forgetProvenNode`. `/hook/*` never 403s a missing token: the phone, the cross-instance
  failover and every pre-token session legitimately have none.
- **Fullscreen TUI (Claude)** — through the SAME `settings.json` seam the hook installer uses,
  nodeterm ensures Claude's `"tui": "fullscreen"` so a session takes the alternate screen + mouse
  and behaves natively in tmux (else a drag falls into copy-mode). Two guardrails: **write-if-absent**
  (any existing `tui` value — e.g. a user's `/tui default` — is never touched;
  `core/agents/hooks/claude-tui.ts` `ensureFullscreenTui`) and **version-gated** to CLI ≥ 2.1.89
  (`supportsFullscreenTui` / `claudeCliCaps().fullscreenTui`; unknown ⇒ don't write). Runs
  everywhere the hook seam does: local `~/.claude` + managed account dirs at launch/add-account
  (`ensureClaudeFullscreenTui{,Into}`), and the remote host + account dirs on SSH connect
  (`RemoteHooks.ensureFullscreenTui{,InAccountDir}`, gated on the connection's cached remote probe).
  **Grok has no analogue** — it runs full-screen by default, so there is nothing to write.
- **Unread + notification** — on a busy→idle edge while the window is unfocused
  (`document.hasFocus()`), the node is marked unread (header dot, minimap stroke, project-tab
  dot). If notifications are enabled, `window.nodeTerminal.notify()` → main `app:notify`
  (shown only when `mainWin.isFocused()` is false); clicking it focuses the window and sends
  `app:focus-node` → `Canvas.focusNodeById` (selects + centers, switching projects via
  `pendingFocusRef` if needed). A one-time consent prompt gates notifications; toggle in
  Settings (`notifyOnClaudeDone`). Selecting, focusing, dwelling into, or opening a session card
  clears `unread` and ACKs the finish across phone/notch surfaces — existing read-on-view behavior.
  This NEVER changes the workflow bucket: read state is independent from agent state.
- **Status-grouped sessions** — three always-visible sections: **Waiting for your response** maps
  internal `done`, `waiting`, and `blocked` together (a completed turn, question, or approval all
  need the user); **Running** maps `working`; **Unknown** means no live hook state is available.
  There is no Done bucket: a normal `done` hook means the turn ended and the agent is waiting for
  another user prompt. Within each section rows sort newest-first by `lastEventAt`, the transition
  clock (same-state hook freshness is `stateAt`), and show its short relative age. Missing clocks
  stay last with no made-up timestamp. A click may clear the glow but cannot move the row.
- **Session name ⇄ node title** — **two lists, because the two directions are separate facts**:
  `TITLE_READ_CAPABLE` (`canReadTitle` — claude, **codex**, grok, **gemini**) is the READ leg,
  `RENAME_CAPABLE` (`canRename` — claude, grok) the WRITE leg, and **read ⊇ write** is an invariant
  pinned in `config.capabilities.test.ts`. Gemini and codex are the reason: they name their own
  sessions (codex via `readCodexSessionName`) but have **no rename command** (gemini's `/chat save
  <tag>` is a checkpoint, not a title), so one list for both legs would light the rename UI on a
  node where the write silently does nothing. The **write** is the same literal
  `/rename <name>` for claude and grok; the **read** legs are per-agent and none may ever
  search another's tree, so the routing lives in ONE place, `core/agent-session-name.ts`
  (`readAgentSessionName(sessionId, accountId?, agentId?, deps?)` — trailing/optional so every pre-grok
  caller is unchanged), serving the desktop IPC handler **and** both shells' session-name sweeps.
  Grok's read leg is `core/grok-session.ts` over `summary.json` in the session dir a hook told us
  about; gemini's is `pickGeminiTitle` (`core/gemini-session.ts`) over the transcript path its context
  tail already tracks — including the `$set` history a **resume** replays, which is exactly the case the
  read leg exists for. Routing is not cosmetic — claude's resolver *scans* `~/.claude/projects` on a
  cache miss, so an unrouted grok/gemini node paid that scan every 60 s for a guaranteed null.
  **The sweep's gate lives in core, not in the shells:** `startSessionNameSweep` defaults `supports` to
  `supportsTitleRead` (`core/session-name-sweep.ts`) and neither shell passes it — the duplicated copies
  drifted, and reverting both to `canRename` left the whole suite green while silently skipping every
  gemini node.
  - **session → title (read, claude):** the authoritative name lives in the transcript `.jsonl`, not the
    OSC terminal title (`/rename` does **not** update OSC — a known Claude gap — so reading the
    file is the only thing that works after a **resume**). `core/transcript-reader.ts`
    `readSessionName(sessionId)` resolves the session file **strictly by sessionId** (no cwd
    fallback — that would make every Claude node in one folder resolve to the same newest transcript
    and adopt each other's names) and `pickSessionName` returns the latest `custom-title`'s
    `customTitle` (the `/rename` name) else the latest `ai-title`'s `aiTitle` (auto name). Exposed
    over `pty.readSessionName`. `TerminalNode` polls it (~4 s) **only once this node's own sessionId
    is known** and **while the title still auto-tracks** (`data.titleAuto`, default true on agent
    nodes), and adopts it as the `title`. `term.onTitleChange` now feeds the `session` chip only.
  - **title → session (write):** the moment the user renames the node by hand (header rename box /
    ✦ AI-name / sidebar / command palette → all funnel through `applyManualTitle` or
    `renameSession`), `titleAuto` flips to **false** (polling stops overwriting) and the chosen name
    is pushed into the live session as `/rename <name>` via `pty.sendText` (tmux `send-keys`, same
    one-way bridge as Branch's `/branch`; works whether or not the node is mounted).
  - The launch command is left bare (no `-n`) — Claude's own name is canonical until the user
    overrides it; `titleAuto` is persisted so an overridden name survives reload/resume.
- **Search** — the command palette (⌘K) matches the session name + tags + `nt-<id>` in the
  hint, and substring-searches each terminal's **visible buffer** (captured via `pty.capture`
  on palette open, cached ~3s); content matches show "found in output".
- **⌘M transcript view (`ChatPanel`) — resolution is three-legged, and each leg fails differently.**
  `chat.readTranscript(sessionId, cwd, accountId, nodeId)` returns `ChatTranscriptResult
  {messages, found}`, NOT a bare array: an empty thread and an unresolvable transcript are
  different facts, and rendering both as "No conversation yet." is what made every failure below
  look like an empty session. (1) **Remote (SSH) nodes** — `remoteTranscriptBySession` is fed
  ONLY by hook POSTs, and a tmux session outlives the app, so after a restart an idle remote node
  has no ref and the local resolvers search the WRONG MACHINE. `remoteTranscriptRefFor` (main)
  therefore asks the host itself: the pure `core/remote-transcript-locate.ts` builds one `sh` line
  (exact `<root>/<encoded cwd>/<id>.jsonl` per root, then a glob; account root before the system
  one; `*` outside the quotes; **exits 0 on a clean miss** — "no transcript" is an answer, not a
  failed ssh), it runs over the ControlMaster, and the reply is jailed by
  `isSafeRemoteTranscriptPath` before it is read. A ref WE located is tracked in
  `locatedTranscriptSessions` so a dead one can be dropped on an empty read (the panel's Retry
  would otherwise replay it forever) — a HOOK-fed ref is never dropped that way, since an empty
  read there is usually a transient master hiccup and forgetting it sends the next read local.
  It is generated shell, so `remote-transcript-locate.test.ts` runs it for real under `/bin/sh`
  against a fake host tree — keep it that way. (2) **The cwd fallback keeps `accountId`** in BOTH
  `resolveTranscript` and `contextEnsure`; without it a managed-account node fell back to the
  system root and could adopt an unrelated session's newest transcript. (3) **Relay tabs** stay
  local-only (a transcript read over the relay would read the GUEST's disk) and reject with
  `E_UNSUPPORTED`; ChatPanel catches it and says so instead of leaving the initial `[]` on screen
  as an empty conversation. Same `nodeId` rides `claude.readTranscript`, so the find-bar searches
  a remote node's transcript too.
  **Both channels live in `core/transcript-ipc.ts` (`registerTranscriptIpc`), so the Server
  Edition serves them too** — it used to have no handler at all, which is why ⌘M in the browser
  read as an empty conversation on EVERY session. The remote leg is an injected dep
  (`readRemote` — `null` = "not a remote session"): `src/main` supplies it, the server passes
  none, which is complete there because it runs ON the host whose transcripts it reads. The
  server registers it in `src/server/index.ts` right after `wireAgentStatus` (which now returns
  its `contextTail`, the hook-fed path authority). The browser's real reader is
  `buildTranscriptApi` in ws-bridge — deliberately NOT folded into `buildClaudeApi`, which the
  relay shares and must not adopt it.
- **Subagent visualization** (agents in `SUBAGENT_CAPABLE`) — `subagent-start`/`subagent-end`
  normalized events (from Claude's `PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse` on tool `Agent`/`Task`, correlated
  by `tool_use_id`) drive a transient `state/agentNodes.ts` store. Claude launches subagents
  **async by default**: that PostToolUse is only a launch ack (`status:'async_launched'`), NOT the
  end — normalize keeps the card working, the transcript tail keeps streaming, and the real end is
  the `<task-notification>` queued into the parent transcript (sniffed by the context tails →
  synthetic `subagent-end` in `index.ts`; the notification's `UserPromptSubmit` is also not a
  `newTurn`, so it doesn't clear the fan-out). Canvas renders each subagent
  as an **ephemeral** `SubagentNode` (display-only card: type + task + working/done) connected by
  an **edge** to its parent agent node. These ephemeral nodes/edges live outside the React Flow
  `nodes` state (merged only at the `<ReactFlow>` prop), so they're never persisted
  (`flowToNodeStates`) nor in undo/dirty. Fan-out is cleared on the next new turn / session-end /
  node close. (Subagents share the parent's process — no PTY.) Each card shows
  duration/tokens/tool-uses and **expands** (click) to a **live transcript**:
  `core/subagent-tail.ts` resolves the subagent's own transcript file
  (`<…>/<sessionId>/subagents/agent-<id>.jsonl`, matched by `tool_use_id` via the sibling
  `.meta.json`), tails it read-only, formats each line (assistant text + tool calls + results),
  and streams chunks over `agent:subagent-activity` into the store.
- **/loop, /schedule & /cron node** (agents in `RECURRING_CAPABLE`) — detected from the **tools**
  the agent invokes (robust; users often phrase it in natural language so the prompt rarely starts
  with the slash): `PreToolUse` for `Skill` (skill ∈ loop/schedule/cron), `CronCreate` (→ cron,
  label = cron expr · prompt), or `ScheduleWakeup` (→ loop) — plus a `UserPromptSubmit`
  `/loop|/schedule|/cron` prompt-prefix fallback, all surfaced as `recurring` normalized events.
  Sets `agentStatus.loop` ({count, prompt, items, kind}); for in-session `loop` each turn-done
  bumps the count + appends `lastMessage` (schedule/cron run in the background, so they aren't
  counted). Lifetime by kind: `loop` dies with its session; `cron`/`schedule` **outlive turns,
  sessions and app restarts** (`loop` is persisted in the agentStatus localStorage) and are
  cleared by a `CronDelete` `recurring`-end event or the card's own × (dismisses the card only).
  `clearForParent` (new turn) leaves the loop card's dragged position alone. Renders an ephemeral
  **LoopNode** labelled by kind, connected by an edge to the parent, plus a small header badge.
- **Branch conversation** — node action (`IconBranch`, Claude-only via `BRANCH_CAPABLE`): sends `/branch` into the
  existing terminal via `pty.sendText` (tmux `send-keys`) and opens a new Claude node that
  resumes the parked original with `claude --settings … -r <ORIGINAL_ID>`. The original id is
  the session id already known from hooks; `lib/claudeBranch.ts` is the fallback that parses
  `pty.capture` output when the id isn't known. The source node stays on the new branch.
- **Canvas control (manage-nodeterm-canvas)** — agents in `CANVAS_CONTROL_CAPABLE`
  (claude/codex/gemini/copilot/opencode/grok) can create/organize/control canvas nodes from inside their
  session: a POSIX **sh+curl** shim (`nodeterm.sh`, `CONTROL_SHIM_SCRIPT` in
  `main/canvas-control-core.ts` — the Electron-as-Node CLI is retired) POSTs
  **form-urlencoded** (`nodeId` + `arg.<flag>` fields; `curl --data-urlencode` is the only
  escaping sh can be trusted with — `parseControlBody` reads both this and the JSON dialect) to
  the hook server's `/control/<verb>` routes; `Accept: text/plain` makes the server render the
  reply (sh has no JSON parser). Env-gated on `NODETERM_CANVAS_CONTROL` (set by
  `buildPtyEnv`/`remoteHookEnvArgs` per `canControlCanvas`). Discovery: claude gets a
  `skills/manage-nodeterm-canvas/SKILL.md` (system `~/.claude` + each managed account dir);
  codex/gemini/opencode plus Copilot's `copilot-instructions.md` get a marker block
  (`<!-- nodeterm:manage-canvas:start/end -->`); **grok needs
  no installer at all** — it scans `~/.claude/skills` by default for Claude compat, so membership alone
  (which sets `NODETERM_CANVAS_CONTROL`) is the whole wiring. That premise rests on grok's shipped
  docs and is **unverified** (`grok inspect --json` never run); if it does not hold, grok takes the
  marker-block route instead — see docs/grok-agent.md.
  **SSH projects** (docs/ssh-agent-skills.md): the SAME shim + skill + blocks are installed on
  the remote host at connect (`RemoteHooks.installCanvasControl` + per-account
  `installCanvasSkillIntoAccountDir`), gated on the VERIFIED reverse hook tunnel — the shim
  carries no machine-specific paths and POSTs through the tunnel's unix socket, so remote agents
  control the desktop's canvas. The shim is generated source no compiler checks:
  `canvas-control-shim.test.ts` runs it for real (/bin/sh against a real hook server, port AND
  unix-socket transports) — keep it that way.
  **Keep the agent-facing text in sync with behaviour, in the SAME PR.** The verb help agents
  actually read is generated by `buildCanvasSkillBody` (the SKILL.md, rewritten into every config
  dir by `installCanvasSkillInto` on launch) and `buildCanvasControlInstructions` (the
  codex/gemini/copilot/opencode marker block) — both in `canvas-control-core.ts`. When you add or
  rename a verb, change a flag, or change what an outcome MEANS (e.g. PR 7 turned a busy target's
  `targetBusy` refusal into a deliver-on-idle queue), update those two functions in the same change,
  or the docs describe a product that no longer exists and an orchestrating agent acts on the stale
  contract. Derive from the code, never re-type: the retry guidance renders from `RETRYABLE`
  (`messagingGuidanceLines`) so a new outcome kind lands in the text the day it is added — prefer
  that shape over prose you have to remember to edit. `canvas-control-core.test.ts` walks both
  generated bodies and must red on the stale claim (it pins the queue wording and the RETRYABLE
  split); a doc line with no such test is a plan, not a fact — see the drift that shipped as #269.
  **Flag syntax**: `--flag value`, `--flag=value`, or a valueless flag anywhere on the line. The
  shim used to consume the next token after any `--flag` *unconditionally*, so `--read --node b1`
  became `arg.read=--node` with `b1` silently dropped and the server answering about the wrong
  flag; it now peeks. The trade: a value that itself starts with `--` must use the `=` form
  (`--cmd=--version`), which was previously unexpressible in either direction. Two parsers are in
  play and both are tested — the sh loop (`control-shim-parse.test.ts`, real `sh` + a fake `curl`
  that records argv) and `parseControlBody` reading what it built (`canvas-control-shim.test.ts`).
  **A new verb must not DEPEND on the fix**: the shim is rewritten locally every app boot but onto
  an SSH host only inside `RemoteHooks.setup()` (on connect), so an already-connected project keeps
  the old loop with no signal on the wire. Give every flag a value and both loops agree.
  **Grouping verbs** (`group` / `ungroup` / `move` / `arrange` / `align`): `group` wraps **sibling**
  objects — nodes or frames — into a new frame in their shared container (a mixed-container set, or
  an ancestor plus its descendant, is refused with that reason); `ungroup --group <id>` dissolves a
  frame, promoting its direct children into the frame's own parent (nodes kept); `move
  --nodes <id,id> [--group <id>]` reparents nodes OR whole frame subtrees INTO a frame (or
  `top`/`none`/omit → out to top level) via `reparentNode` — the ONE way to move a node between
  frames, which `group` won't do; a cycle (a frame into itself or its own descendant) is refused.
  `arrange`/`align` now run in ONE coordinate space: all top-level, OR all children of one frame
  (`commonParentId` decides; a mixed set is refused, not silently subset-arranged — the old
  behavior). When the ids are a frame's children, the frame is shrunk to hug the tidied layout
  (`fitGroupToChildren`) — the fix for "grouping keeps scattered positions so the frame is too
  wide". `move` also re-fits the source + destination frames. All pure + tested in
  `state/workspace.test.ts` + `workspace.layout.test.ts`.
  **Fan-in (`link`, 2026-07):** a spawned fan-out was previously write-only — nodes an agent
  opened were joined to it by a **rope** (`project.ropes`, explicitly *"Display-only — never
  context links"*), so an orchestrator could not read back what its own team produced and the
  skill told it to have the USER relay results. Now `open-claude`/`open-agent`/`spawn-team` also
  draw a real **context bridge** (`project.bridges`) to each agent session they open, and the
  `link --to <id,id> [--from <id>]` verb links nodes the agent did not open (or two other nodes).
  The rope stays — the two edges mean different things (lineage vs readable context) and a
  non-context-capable target still gets only the rope. Deliberately **silent**: the manual
  `onConnect` path pushes a discovery note into both endpoints, but doing that per team member
  would inject a prompt into every session an agent just spawned — the exact intrusion that push
  was reverted for. Links are pull-based, so nothing is lost. The refusal matrix is the pure
  `planBridges` (`renderer/lib/noteLink.ts`, unit-tested); Canvas only wraps it in setState.
  Callers that create and link nodes **in the same tick** must pass their own `lookup` — `setNodes`
  is async, so resolving fresh nodes off `nodesRef` would skip every one as "no such node".
  **Dependency edges (`--after`, 2026-07):** `open-terminal`/`open-claude`/`open-agent` accept
  `--after <id,id>`, which opens the node **armed** — `data.pendingLaunch` ({after, command},
  `PendingLaunch` in shared/types) holds the launch the factory built, and Canvas fires it once
  every dep reports `done`. This is what makes the canvas a DAG instead of a fan-out. Load-bearing
  details: (1) **an unknown agent state is NOT "satisfied"** — right after a fan-out no upstream has
  emitted a hook event yet, and reading "no news" as "finished" would fire every dependent
  instantly; a **deleted** dep IS satisfied (it can never report). (2) Only `hasHooks` agents may be
  waited on — a plain terminal never reports done, so `resolveAfter` **refuses** it rather than
  letting `launchesToFire` (which cannot tell "never will" from "not yet") hang the node forever.
  (3) If the deps are **already satisfied at creation**, the node is NOT armed: the command stays
  `initialCommand` so the node's own mount path delivers it through `writeWhenShellReady` —
  arming would hand delivery to the canvas effect, which races the node's PTY into existence.
  (4) Delivery is **exactly-once via `launchInFlight`** (an id stays in the set forever once
  `sendText` resolved true — clearing `pendingLaunch` is a state update that can lag a re-render),
  and a **refused** `sendText` retries (`LAUNCH_DELIVERY_ATTEMPTS`) instead of vanishing.
  (5) `pendingLaunch` **is persisted** (unlike `initialCommand`), but agent state is not — so after
  a restart nothing will ever report `done` and the node carries a manual ▶ **run-now** escape in
  its QUEUED badge. (6) Canvas subscribes to `armedDepSig`, NOT `useAgentStatus(s => s.byId)` —
  the same discipline as `loopSig`; the full map re-renders the canvas on every hook event.
  Pure logic + refusal matrix in `renderer/lib/pendingLaunch.ts` (unit-tested); the dashed dep→node
  edges are **derived, never persisted** (a pending dependency is a state that ends when the launch
  fires — the durable relation is the context bridge `--after` also draws).
  **Review panel (`verify`, 2026-07):** `verify --node <id> [--lenses …] [--focus …] [--agent …]
  [--synthesis off]` opens one reviewer per LENS, each armed behind the target (`--after`) and
  bridged to it, wrapped in a `Verify: <title>` group, plus a judge armed behind the whole panel.
  It is **composition, not new machinery** — the two primitives above are the whole implementation.
  Prompt/lens logic is the pure, unit-tested `renderer/lib/verifyPanel.ts`; two wordings there are
  load-bearing and must not be "tightened away": reviewers are told **not to edit** (a panel is N
  agents pointed at ONE checkout — review and repair are different jobs, and only repair needs
  worktree isolation) and are explicitly **licensed to find nothing** (a reviewer under implicit
  pressure to produce findings invents them, and an invented finding costs someone else the time to
  disprove it). Unknown lens words are **kept** with a generic brief, not rejected — a table that
  only accepts what it already knows would be useless for the review nobody anticipated. Reviewers
  inherit the TARGET's `accountId` (its transcript resolves inside that account dir), not the
  caller's. The judge is armed on ids that exist only in that tick, which is why `armAfter` takes
  `extraLive` — without it the reviewers would look *deleted*, deletion counts as satisfied, and
  the judge would fire before a single review existed.
- **Context Link** — a node action gated by `CONTEXT_LINK_CAPABLE` (claude/codex/gemini/opencode;
  **grok**, custom agents + plain terminals excluded — grok's `updates.jsonl` parser is unbuilt): drawing an edge between two builtin-agent nodes lets each
  READ the other's context on demand (pull, not push). Architecture (2026-07, SSH-capable — see
  docs/ssh-agent-skills.md): the **desktop does the reading AND the parsing**; the CLI the agent
  runs (`context.sh`) is a thin POSIX **sh+curl** shim that POSTs to the hook server's
  `/context-link/<verb>` route and prints the text/plain reply (the Electron-as-Node CLI is
  retired — its embedded-JS parser now lives as tested TS in `core/context-link-render.ts`:
  parsers for **all four** formats — claude JSONL / codex rollout / gemini event-sourced chat /
  opencode export — plus `renderContextLink` over injected fetchers). `src/core/context-link.ts`
  holds the link docs in memory (per-node files under `<userData>/context-links/` remain as a
  debug aid), carries per-entry `agentId`/`sessionId`/`accountId`, and answers the route;
  **authorization** = the doc is selected by the REQUESTER's node id, so a token-holding caller
  can only read nodes in its own (directional) link map. Codex/gemini paths resolve via the
  handoff locators (`locateCodex`/`locateGemini` by sessionId); claude keeps the hook-fed path +
  `locateClaude(sessionId, accountId)` fallback (cwd-newest is claude-only); Canvas rewrites link
  files when a linked node's sessionId appears (`linkSessionSig`). **SSH projects:** the shim +
  skill are installed on the remote host at connect (`RemoteHooks.installContextLink`, gated on
  the VERIFIED reverse hook tunnel; POSTs ride `--unix-socket` through it); a remote node's
  transcript is read over the ControlMaster (`initContextLink(ptyManager, deps)` — `src/main`
  injects `isRemoteNode`/`readRemoteFile`/`runRemoteCommand`, bounded tail reads), its hook-fed
  path is jailed at ingest (`isSafeRemoteTranscriptPath`), and `resolveLinkTranscript` REFUSES
  the local locators for remote nodes (they'd resolve a stranger's local transcript). Server
  Edition passes no deps → local-only (context link is NOT wired there at all — `initContextLink`
  is never called from `src/server`). Discovery is per-agent: claude installs a
  `get-linked-context` skill; codex/gemini get an idempotent marker block
  (`<!-- nodeterm:get-linked-context:start/end -->`) merged into `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` /
  `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`. On connect an idle-gated one-line note is injected into each endpoint
  (claude → skill pointer; codex/gemini → inline CLI command via `contextLink.info()`).
  (Replaced the earlier MCP-based bridge.)
  **Note links:** a sticky note can be connected to ANY terminal node (one-way, sticky →
  terminal). On connect, agent sessions get a one-shot idle-gated push of the note text
  (`buildNotePushMessage`, single-line, truncated at 2000 chars); plain terminals get no
  push (sendText appends Enter — the text would execute). The note's live text also rides
  the link file (`ContextLinkInfo.note`), so Claude reads the current text via the
  get-linked-context CLI (`summary`/`transcript` print it; `list` marks `(note)`). Pure
  edge/push/map logic in `renderer/lib/noteLink.ts`.
- **Managed Claude accounts** (Claude-only) — run several logged-in Claude identities side by
  side by giving each its own config dir. `settings.claudeAccounts` is a list of `ClaudeAccount
  {id, label, email?, host?, pending?, createdAt}` (in `settings.json`; the account **list** is
  config, not credentials). Isolation is **config-dir**, not token storage: a local account's dir
  is `{userData}/claude-accounts/<id>` (`claudeConfigDirFor` / pure `accountConfigDir`),
  a **remote** account's is `~/.nodeterm/claude-accounts/<id>` on its `host` (keyed by
  `sshHostKey` = `user@host`; `remoteAccountConfigDir` is `~`-relative for ssh expansion,
  `remoteAccountConfigDirAbs` resolves it against the connection's `remoteHome`). The **claude
  CLI owns login, credential storage, and token refresh** inside that dir — the app NEVER writes
  credentials. On macOS this works because Claude Code **≥ 2.1** scopes its Keychain service per
  config dir (`Claude Code-credentials-<sha256(configDir)[:8]>`, `claudeKeychainService`); on
  < 2.1 one unscoped service is shared → accounts collide, so add-account **warns** (`claude
  --version`, `isSupportedClaudeVersion`).
  - **`data.accountId` (terminal nodes)** — resolved **once at node creation**
    (`resolveNewNodeAccount`: explicit submenu pick → `project.defaultAccountId` → system default
    `~/.claude`), then **immutable** and **persisted** (serializers). `undefined` = system default
    = **bit-for-bit legacy behavior** (no env touched). Inherited by **Branch** (the
    terminal→chat fork it also fed is gone — the SDK chat node was removed 2026-07). Two #419
    rules inside the resolver: the submenu's **System row passes `null`** (an EXPLICIT system
    pick that skips the project default — before that, the row wearing the system email launched
    the project-default account), and validation runs against `accountsForProject`, not the raw
    list, so a **pending** account or one **pinned to another machine's host** is never stamped
    onto a node it cannot run on (both used to reach the missing-dir fallback at spawn).
  - **Env injection** — `pty-manager` sets `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` in the spawn env AND as a tmux `-e`
    (local); for a remote node it emits an **absolute-path** remote tmux `-e` built from the
    connection-cached `remoteHome` (skipped **fail-open** if home is unresolved). `AUTH_ENV_STRIP`
    (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` / `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`) is deleted from the
    child env so a stray env key can't shadow the account. A **missing** account dir → warn +
    silent system fallback. **The account-scope names ride the LOCAL conf's `update-environment`
    (`ACCOUNT_SCOPE_UPDATE_ENV`, issue #419)** — the shared tmux server inherits the env of the
    client that STARTS it, so a server started by a managed-account node used to leak that
    account's `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` (and any un-stripped auth key) into every session created
    without a `-e` override: system nodes, plain terminals and the missing-dir fallback silently
    ran as that account ("the system account is entangled with the next account in the list").
    Listing the names makes tmux copy each from the creating client's env and **strip it when the
    client lacks it** (proven against a real tmux in `account-env.realtmux.test.ts`, seeded-server
    case included; `ensureUpdateEnvKeys` retrofits a long-lived pre-fix server). The same listing
    is what makes codex's explicit system-scope overwrite (`CODEX_HOME` /
    `NODETERM_CODEX_ACCOUNT_ID`) actually reach sessions on a shared server. **LOCAL conf only**
    — the remote conf must NOT get these names: a remote attach client's env is the login
    shell's, and the copy/strip would run against that wrong environment (pinned in
    `ssh.test.ts`).
  - **Login flow** — Settings → Accounts → **Add** creates a `pending` account and drops a canvas
    **login node** that runs `claude /login` under the account dir. Main polls the dir's
    `.claude.json` (`LOGIN_POLL_MS` 2 s, up to `LOGIN_TIMEOUT_MS` 5 min) for `oauthAccount.email`;
    on capture the account flips out of `pending` with its email as the default label. Account
    removal cancels any pending wait + `markDirty`. **Codex accounts have the same two halves** —
    `createCodexAccountLoginNode` (`codex login`, title "Codex login") behind the
    `nodeterm:add-codex-account-login` listener, with `codexAccounts.waitLogin` polling the managed
    home's `auth.json`. Both flows mint an **agent-less terminal** carrying only `accountId`, and
    that shape is why `needsCodexAccountScope` takes an `isCodexAccount` resolver rather than
    reading `!!accountId`: the two account lists share an id alphabet, so the id alone cannot say
    which provider it belongs to. Guessing "codex" refused every managed **Claude** node (#345);
    guessing "not codex" would let `codex login` write into the system `~/.codex`. A dispatch with
    no listener is a silent no-op, which is how the Codex half shipped inert (#346) — pinned now by
    `renderer/lib/nodeterm-events.test.ts`, which fails on any `nodeterm:*` event that is sent but
    never heard.
  - **Hook install** — the managed hook is merged into **each account dir's** `settings.json` at
    add-account **and** at app launch (local, shared `install-helper.ts`) / via
    `RemoteHooks.installIntoAccountDir` (remote), so every identity reports agent status.
  - **Account-aware readers** — transcript resolution is scoped per account (`transcriptRootFor`
    picks the account dir's `projects/`, composite cache key includes `accountId`); the same
    threading runs through the session-name poll, restart handoff, and `ChatPanel` (the ⌘M
    transcript view, `chat.readTranscript`). The **usage indicator** is per account (`claude-usage.ts`: scoped Keychain
    service first, legacy unscoped fallback; popover lists a row per account with **System**
    first). **Remote (SSH host) accounts are included** — see **Remote usage** below.
  - **Pickers** — New Claude exposes an account **submenu** (pane menu; flat entries in
    the dock; palette commands; TabBar sets the **per-project default**). A **local** project
    lists local accounts, an **SSH** project lists only accounts whose `host` matches its
    connection; both offer a **System account** option. An SSH project whose host has **no**
    matching accounts gets a disabled hint row instead of a bare System-only list
    (`sshAccountsHint` — pane submenu, dock, TabBar; the palette deliberately omits it: a
    disabled row would surface as a search result) saying accounts for this host are added in
    Settings → Accounts while the project is connected — local accounts being invisible there is
    correct (their credentials aren't on the host) but read as "multi-account is broken on SSH".
  - **Remote accounts** — selection + login + env injection, plus **usage** (below); no
    per-account transcript readers beyond env.
  - **Switch account (running node)** — the node context menu's **Switch account** submenu moves an
    already-running Claude session onto another local account (or back to the system `~/.claude`).
    Because `data.accountId` is immutable at creation, this is a **copy-then-flip cold restore**,
    not a mutation of the live dir. The **transcript-copy invariant** is the whole point: the
    file-level half is the core service `copySessionTranscript` (`core/account-transcript-copy.ts`,
    IPC `claude:copy-session-transcript`, registered in **BOTH** shells, reached at
    `window.nodeTerminal.claude.copySessionTranscript`), which mirrors `<sessionId>.jsonl` **and**
    its subagents sibling tree from the source account's `projects` root into the target's
    (`transcriptRootFor`), STRICTLY by sessionId (never the newest transcript). The renderer driver
    `executeAccountSwitch` (`renderer/lib/accountSwitch.ts`) runs the ONE safe order: **copy FIRST**,
    then identity-gated `terminateForeground` → `transport.recycle(id)` → `updateNodeData(id,
    {accountId: target|undefined, respawnNonce: +1})` (the model-switch sequence); **a failed copy
    mutates NOTHING** — a resume that finds no transcript in the target dir is a lost conversation.
    Refusal matrix (`planAccountSwitch`, fail-closed): not a Claude node, a **remote** session
    (relay tab / SSH-project node — those account dirs live on another machine), **busy**
    (`working`/`blocked`), no resumable sessionId, a **same-account** no-op, or a target that is
    missing / forged / `host`ed / still `pending`. Both `fromAccountId`/`toAccountId` are validated
    with the same rule as `accountConfigDir` (`isSafeAccountId`) at the handler AND with a
    defense-in-depth regex in the renderer — a forged id interpolated into a path must never
    traverse. Server Edition switches accounts too (no remote leg — the server runs ON the host).

- **The usage indicator is scoped to the ACTIVE project** (`renderer/lib/usageScope.ts`, pure +
  unit-tested) — it describes **the machine that project runs on**, and nothing else. A local
  project shows this machine (system + managed local accounts + the billing providers, whose
  credentials are all local); an **SSH project shows only that host's Claude accounts** — no local
  Claude, no local providers, no other host. Without this the panel showed every source at once:
  each addition was individually reasonable and the sum was unreadable, numbers from three
  machines sharing one line with nothing saying which was which. Deliberately NOT narrowed to the
  project's `defaultAccountId`: the local side lists every local identity, so the machine is the
  scope and the account is a row within it. The pill spells out the scoped machine's **system**
  account (falling back to the first identity with data, so a host used only through a managed
  login isn't blank), managed accounts stay popover-only — the rule the local side always had.
  `usageScopeKey`/`scopeFromKey` exist because the active project object is rebuilt on every node
  serialization: the zustand selector returns ONE primitive so the indicator doesn't re-render on
  every canvas edit. ⟳ refreshes only what is on screen, and `usage.remote({hostKey})` reads only
  that host (cache eviction still runs against the FULL target list, so switching between two SSH
  projects doesn't throw each host's cache away).

- **Remote usage** (SSH hosts, `src/core/usage/remote-claude-usage.ts`) — the source behind the
  SSH scope above. v1 excluded remote accounts, which left a user whose Claude only ever runs on a
  server staring at an empty indicator while the host had perfectly good numbers.
  **The token never leaves the host.** The desktop could `cat` the remote `.credentials.json` and
  call the API itself — it already reads remote transcripts over the same master — but a bearer
  token pulled off a (possibly shared) server into another machine's memory buys nothing: the host
  can make the request itself. So core generates a POSIX **sh+curl** command, the shell runs it
  over the project's ControlMaster, and only the JSON answer comes back. Three details are
  load-bearing:
  1. **The token is piped into `curl --config -`, never `-H` on the command line** — argv is
     world-readable via `ps` on a shared host.
  2. **`.credentials.json` holds more than one `accessToken`** — every MCP server the CLI has
     authorized keeps its own under `mcpOAuth`. The extraction narrows to the `claudeAiOauth`
     object first (exactly as the local `parseCreds` does), because grabbing the file's first match
     sends an MCP token to the endpoint, earns a 401, and reports a signed-in host as signed out.
     Caught only by running the command against a REAL credentials file — which is why
     `remote-claude-usage.test.ts` runs the generated script under a real `/bin/sh` against a fake
     `$HOME` + fake `curl`, the same discipline as the canvas-control shim.
  3. **A read that could not run is `error`, never `unavailable`** — a dead master says nothing
     about whether the account has a subscription, and 'unavailable' silently drops the row.
  Shape: `remoteUsageTargets` (pure) elects ONE connected project per host (several projects share
  a host's `$HOME`) and offers its system `~/.claude` plus every managed account pinned to that
  host. The service (`usage:remote`) caches per target under the usual debounce, evicts targets
  whose host disconnected, and coalesces concurrent reads. **On demand, never polled** — each row
  is an ssh exec plus an HTTPS request on someone else's machine; the renderer asks on mount, on
  popover open, on ⟳, and when the active project's connection comes up (an SSH project is opened
  before its master is ready). Deps are injected exactly like
  Context Link's (`src/main` supplies the ControlMaster; **Server Edition passes none** ⇒ `[]`, so
  the UI needs no capability check). Own Settings switch (`claude-remote`), because hiding local
  Claude usage must not silently take the hosts down with it. **Mobile: N/A** — the
  slice pushed to a host still drops `usage` (a host reading its own numbers back off us is
  pointless), and no keychain leg exists remotely (a headless macOS host would hang on the prompt,
  so a mac host reports nothing).

### Adding a new agent (or a new model) — what to watch out for

Every rule below is a mistake the grok branch or the codex/gemini-parity branch **actually made**, and
each one cost a review round or shipped a wrong number to the user. Read the concrete failure, not the
principle. Per-agent write-ups: `docs/grok-agent.md`, `docs/gemini-agent.md`.

**The mechanism**

1. **A capability is a membership list plus ONE leaf.** Add the id to the list in
   `src/shared/agents/config.ts`, write the one per-agent thing that list gates (a normalizer, a
   reader, a table row), and every consumer lights up — the whole point of the design. What you must
   never do is fork behavior at a call site with `=== 'claude'`; ask through the helper.
2. **Ask what ELSE the list gates before joining it.** `hasUsage` gated **three** features, not one.
   Joining `USAGE_CAPABLE` for the context meter also switched on `context.ensure` and the find bar's
   transcript index, both of which resolve through *claude's* `resolveTranscript` — whose **cwd
   fallback** then handed a codex node **the newest claude transcript for that cwd**: a stranger's
   session as its meter (wrong numerator *and* denominator, flapping against the correct tail) and that
   session's messages as its search hits. Preconditions were default-true, so it would have shipped.
   The fix was a new pure predicate (`readsClaudeTranscript`) reusing an existing list, not a fourth
   list meaning the same thing. **Grep every consumer of the helper before you add an id to its list.**
3. **A read leg and a write leg are different facts, and may need different lists.** Gemini names its
   own sessions but has **no rename command**, so `TITLE_READ_CAPABLE` (read) split from
   `RENAME_CAPABLE` (write), with `read ⊇ write` pinned as an invariant. One list would have lit the
   rename UI on a node where the write silently does nothing — the worst kind of feature, one that
   looks like it worked.
4. **State Desktop / Server Edition / Mobile for the capability, even when the answer is "N/A".**
   Put the logic in `src/core` behind `CorePlatform` or the Server Edition silently doesn't have it,
   and give `window.nodeTerminal` a REAL bridge implementation or a documented degrade — a `noop` stub
   compiles fine while doing nothing. (Live example: the session-title READ has no server handler at
   all, so it is stubbed for **claude too** — a pre-existing gap that keeps being rediscovered per
   agent.)

**Measuring the CLI**

5. **Measure the CLI; do not assume claude's shape.** Three real bugs, all from assuming:
   - grok's `--` is **end-of-options**, so a flag appended *after* the prompt separator is a
     positional — silently swallowed into the prompt, or a clap usage error that kills the launch.
     Where the flag lands is decided at the **composed** layer (`createAgentNode`); a
     `withPermissionMode` unit test passes while the composed line is wrong.
   - codex's `total_token_usage` is **CUMULATIVE**, not the live context: against its own window it
     rendered a 13%-full session at **79%** and would have crossed 100% two turns later. The right
     field is `last_token_usage`.
   - `cached` tokens are **INSIDE** `input` for codex and gemini, and **OUTSIDE** it for claude (whose
     reader therefore sums them). Copying claude's formula double-counts. **Do not unify the
     formulas.**
6. **Prefer the agent's own stated number over one you infer.** Codex prints
   `model_context_window` right beside its usage — use it. When there is none, mirror the CLI's own
   resolver rather than building a per-model allowlist: gemini's `tokenLimit()` is a family rule with
   a **1M catch-all default**, so an unreleased model gets the *right* answer where an allowlist would
   be confidently wrong, silently. **And if you cannot establish a trustworthy denominator, ship no
   meter** — a percentage over a guessed window is a wrong number presented as a fact (this is exactly
   why grok has no meter).
7. **A closed set beats a substring, for notification/event types.** Grok's
   `type.includes('permission')` matched a notification grok fires before *every* tool call, so a
   working node strobed NEEDS YOU: unread dot + chime + OS notification + phone inbox card, per tool
   call. Gemini is matched `=== 'ToolPermission'` and stays quiet on an unknown type. A badge stuck on
   a finished node has no later hook to clear it, so widening "to be safe" is the unsafe direction.
8. **"Supports" can be as dishonest as "doesn't support."** Codex claimed `manual` / "Ask each time"
   while emitting **no flag** — but its built-in default is `OnRequest` ("the model decides when to
   ask"), so two dropdown entries collapsed onto one behavior under a label that promised otherwise.
   Rule: a mode the CLI cannot express emits **no flag** (never a substituted nearest match), and a
   mode it *can* express must actually emit it. Derive the UI copy from the mapping
   (`unsupportedModesNote`, `permissionModeAgentIds`) so a sentence cannot drift from the table.
   **The nearest match is most dangerous on the DEFAULT mode:** gemini has no value for `auto`, and
   `auto` is `DEFAULT_PERMISSION_MODE`, so translating it to `auto_edit` ("auto-approve edit tools")
   would have widened permissions for every existing gemini node at upgrade, with `modeSupported`
   answering `true` so the derived copy stayed silent. Check what an UNTOUCHED setting emits before
   you accept any mapping.
9. **A capability gate that is fed by a version probe belongs to the agent it probes.** Claude's
   `auto` gate is fed by `claude --version`; applying it to any other agent downgrades that agent's
   sessions on a machine whose *claude* is old or absent. `activePermissionMode` gates only
   `'claude'`, and every hint string names Claude for the same reason. An agent needing its own gate
   adds one beside claude's.

**Not writing the same rule twice**

10. **A duplicated rule drifts, and this branch was bitten three times.** The remote installer's hook
    event lists (it subscribed gemini to *claude's* event names, so remote gemini reported nothing at
    all), grok's raw-listener field decoding, and the two shells' session-name sweep gates (reverting
    both to `canRename` left the entire suite **green** while silently skipping every gemini node).
    The fix each time was **one definition in `src/core`** consumed by both shells — a default inside
    core beats an argument each shell passes correctly today.
11. **Both shells' raw hook listeners must stay in parity** (`src/main/index.ts`,
    `src/server/agent-status.ts`). If you add a branch to one, add it to the other or write down why
    not (the desktop's extra skip for remote SSH nodes is a legitimate asymmetry: the server has no
    SSH-project manager).
12. **Widen the transcript-path jail per ROOT, never to `$HOME`.** Hook POSTs can arrive over the
    remote reverse tunnel, and `isSafeLocalTranscriptPath` exists so a forged one cannot aim a read at
    `~/.ssh/id_rsa`. Add the narrowest directory that holds the transcripts (`~/.gemini/tmp`,
    `<codexHome>/sessions`) and honor the agent's own relocation env var — getting that wrong fails
    **closed** (the meter silently never fills), which is the quieter and therefore worse failure.
13. **Re-validate a hand-editable value at the interpolation site, not by its type.** Modes come from
    git-shared JSON and end up on a tmux `send-keys` line. A table lookup guarded only by
    `mode in table` accepted a forged `constructor` and returned a **Function** headed for that
    command line; `isPermissionMode` at the top of `approvalFlags` is what closes it. Same rule as
    `SAFE_SESSION_ID`. An unrecognized value must yield the **bare, safe** command.

**Degrading, and admitting what you did not measure**

14. **A guess must degrade to nothing, never to something wrong.** A title reader that cannot resolve
    returns `null` (the node keeps its own name); an unknown notification type is a no-op; a failed
    probe means the bare command, never a blocked launch. Say in the code which facts are *composed*
    rather than captured (gemini's resumed-transcript shape is) and what the wrong-guess cost is.
15. **Kill the "in place" actions carefully.** An exit sequence must be the CLI's documented primary
    and **bare**: gemini's `/quit` also takes `--delete`, which exits *and permanently deletes the
    session history* — the very conversation the restart exists to resume. It has its own test.
    Refuse the restart while the node is `working` **or** `blocked`: an exit line typed into a
    permission prompt **answers** it.
16. **Write the device checklist for what you could not run.** Every unverified claim becomes a
    numbered item; group the ones that fall out of a single capture run. `docs/grok-agent.md` §9 and
    `docs/gemini-agent.md` §9 are the format.
17. **Extend the base harness mapping, never a frontend allowlist.** Model support is
    `MODEL_SWITCH_CAPABLE` plus the protocol/env/flag leaf in `shared/agents/model-gateway.ts`.
    Frontends call `canSwitchModel` / `modelsForAgent`; they never spell Claude, Codex or a custom
    id themselves. This makes `baseAgent:'claude'` inherit discovery, filtering, environment and
    command grammar as one unit instead of four copies that drift.
18. **A model switch must refresh the shell environment without printing the key.** An already-live
    shell does not inherit a later `tmux set-environment`, and prefixing the resume line with
    `KEY=secret` leaks it into the pane/history. SIGTERM the pane's foreground non-shell process
    group (a typed `/exit` can land in the agent composer as prompt text), recycle the persistent
    session, and let cold restore resume with the new model under the newly injected environment.

## Session memory (the RAM pill + the per-session panel)

A bottom-left **RAM pill** (`components/SystemResourcePill.tsx`) beside the usage pill, and the
**session-memory panel** it opens (`components/SessionMemoryPanel.tsx`): used/total RAM of the
machine the **active project** runs on, and every `nt-*` tmux session on that machine sorted by the
memory its whole process TREE holds, each row travelable (`goToNode`) and killable. Scope is
`usageScopeKey` — the same helper the usage indicator uses, so the two pills can never disagree
about which machine they describe. Reading + parsing is `core/session-memory.ts` (this machine) and
`core/session-memory-remote.ts` (an SSH project's host), served over one RPC by
`core/session-memory-service.ts`, which BOTH shells boot. Full write-up + the device checklist:
**`docs/session-memory.md`**.

- **The memory is the agent CLI's own V8 heap — nodeterm does not allocate it, and it is not a
  leak.** Measured on the production host that prompted this (64 GB, 95 live `claude` processes): a
  `claude` process alone averages **335 MB** and peaked at **1159 MB**; 95 of them held **31.1 GB**;
  MCP children add 30–200 MB per session (playwright-mcp + Chrome ≈ 200 MB alone), so one "Claude
  terminal" tree is **440 MB – 1.2 GB**. `RssAnon` is essentially all of the RSS (1165 MB of 1187 MB
  on the largest process) and the repo sets no `NODE_OPTIONS`, so V8 sizes its heap off system RAM
  (`heap_size_limit` 4144 MB there). It is flat with process age — 0–24 h avg **340 MB** vs 7 day+
  avg **326 MB** — so each process takes a baseline and never returns it. **Write those numbers down
  rather than re-deriving them.** The user's number was right and their attribution was wrong; what
  the product was missing was not the allocation but the **blindness** — nothing told them 18
  sessions were live, that one was 1.2 GB, or that six belonged to a project they closed weeks ago.
- **The reaper is deliberately unchanged.** `core/session-budget.ts` reaps only **detached** sessions
  past a grace window, so on that host its kill list was **EMPTY** — 60 `nt-` sessions, 50 attached,
  0 eligible — while 31 GB sat there. An open canvas is attached, and attached is untouchable.
  Retargeting it is a separate change with separate risk; this feature adds **sight**, not policy.
- **`ok:false` is not `ok:true` with no rows** — the rule the whole feature exists to honour, and
  every layer preserves it. A sweep fails (no tmux, unreadable process table, **no socket answered**,
  a missing or out-of-order marker in the SSH reply, a rejected call) ⇒ `ok:false` and no rows; the
  panel then says "Could not measure sessions on this machine", and the grand total and the "*n*
  sessions" count are gated on a `measured` flag so a failure can never render as `0 B / 0 sessions`.
  "We looked and there is nothing" is its own sentence. A socket with **no tmux server** is an
  ANSWER, not a failure (`isNoServerError`), and that classifier is **anchored to tmux's own connect
  message**: `promisify(execFile)` folds stderr into `err.message`, and a bare `no such file or
  directory` also matches a tmux client missing a shared library (exit 127 on *every* socket) and a
  dead ssh ControlMaster — laundering either into "no sessions here" prints an empty panel over 20
  live ones. **The SSH leg applies the SAME classifier to the same rule**: each socket is fenced in
  the reply with its tmux exit status and its stderr (`##SOCK <name>` … `##SOCKRC <n>`, `2>&1`), and
  zero answers ⇒ `ok:false`. Its first form threw both away (`{ tmux …; tmux …; } || true`), so a
  host whose tmux client could not start emitted a stream byte-identical to an idle host's and the
  panel reported thirty live sessions as "No sessions are running here.". Do not "simplify" the
  fence back out — and do not replace the classifier with a blunt "any error ⇒ ok:false" either: on
  a host with no tmux server at all EVERY socket fails, and there "there are no sessions" is the
  honest answer.
- **`readMemInfo` has exactly one home** (`core/session-memory.ts`); `session-budget.ts` imports and
  re-exports it. The reaper's watermark and the pill must never disagree about how much RAM is free,
  and a second copy is exactly the drift this file warns about elsewhere. `null` = could not read,
  never zero.
- **The local reader reads `/proc/<pid>/status`, never `statm`.** `status` carries `PPid` and `VmRSS`
  in one file, already in kB; `statm` reports RSS in **pages**, forcing a page-size assumption — a
  hard-coded 4096 under-reports **4×** on a 16 KiB-page arm64 kernel and **16×** on the 64 KiB-page
  enterprise arm64 builds (40 MB printed for a 640 MB session). **Do not optimise this back to
  `statm`.** Non-Linux falls through to one `ps -eo pid,ppid,rss` call, through the same injectable
  seam as tmux.
- **`childCount` counts ALL descendants**, the agent CLI included: `pane_pid` is the pane's SHELL, so
  a claude session with two MCP servers reports **3**. The UI therefore says "**child processes**",
  never "MCP" — a plain `npm run dev` has children too.
- **The cadence split follows the cost.** A **local** scope polls the pill's number every 30 s
  (`HOST_POLL_MS`, one file read, free). An **SSH** scope is **never polled**: one read on scope
  entry, one when that project's ControlMaster comes up (an SSH project is opened before its master
  is ready, and with no timer behind it a first read against a dead master leaves the pill blank),
  and one per panel open / `⟳`. Same rule this file already sets for **Remote usage**, for the same
  reason: every remote read is an ssh exec plus a `ps` of somebody else's whole process table. The
  full sweep runs on the panel's MOUNT (it is unmounted while closed) and on `⟳` — never on a timer,
  never from the pill.
- **The pill is the single owner of the store's `startHostPoll` / `stopHostPoll`** — the timer and the
  active-scope stamp are MODULE SINGLETONS. The panel must never call them: a `stopHostPoll` on
  unmount would clear the pill's interval with nothing left to restart it, and the number would
  silently freeze until the next scope change.
- **A closed project is not an orphan.** `closeProject` keeps the project and its nodes on disk, so
  its sessions resolve to a real title and are labelled with their project; calling them orphans
  would invite the user to kill sessions they deliberately parked. `resolveSessionRows` is therefore
  fed EVERY project — filtering to the open tabs defeats the rule silently, from outside the file
  that states it. And **`orphan` is the distinguishing field, NOT `state === null`**: a plain
  terminal never enters the agent-status map, so deriving orphan-ness from a missing agent state
  would flag every one of them. Orphans are the point — they are what the reaper cannot see and no
  canvas can show.
- **On an SSH scope the kill routes over the ACTIVE project's master** (`lib/sessionKill.ts` →
  `sshProject.killSessions`), because `transport.destroy(nodeId)` reaches a remote session only
  through a LIVE local client carrying `sshRemote` — which an orphan has not, and neither has a node
  owned by a non-active project. Before this, every orphan row's `×` on an SSH project **promised a
  kill it could not perform**: the local socket was touched, the host's `nt-<id>` kept running, and
  the row came back on the next refresh unexplained. It is safe because it is a **round trip, not a
  lookup** — the row's `nodeId` is literally `session.slice('nt-')` from the sweep and `killSessions`
  maps it back through the same idempotent `sessionName()`, so the exact session name the sweep
  observed is killed on the host it observed it on (node ids are only per-launch unique, and nothing
  here rests on more). Ownership is re-resolved at click time, not taken from the row's stale
  `orphan` flag, so a node created since the sweep is not killed as an orphan.
- **The name and the host were never the hard part — the SOCKET was.** Two nodeterm tmux sockets
  live on one machine at once (`node-terminal` for a nodeterm running ON it, `nodeterm-rmt` for one
  SSH-ing INTO it) and the sweep lists **both**, while the kill targeted one — so every row off the
  other socket got "this stops its tmux session" and a kill that landed nowhere. Not exotic: a host
  running its own `nodeterm-server` while being SSH'd into is exactly that, and the local mirror
  (this machine's panel listing the `nodeterm-rmt` sessions another machine's nodeterm spawned here,
  all orphans locally) is the same shape. A kill that knows only a NAME therefore goes to **every
  socket that name could be on** (`KILL_TMUX_SOCKETS` → `remoteTmuxKillEverySocketArgs` /
  `localKillSockets`), which is safe because tmux's "can't find session" was already the ignored
  case, because the target is **exact** (`-t =nt-<id>`: without `=` tmux falls back to fnmatch then
  PREFIX matching on a miss, and `nt-…-1` is a prefix of `nt-…-12`, so a miss could kill a different
  session), and because the fan-out is **opt-in and asked for by exactly one caller**: it needs both
  "we do not know the socket" AND `everySocket` from the caller (`localKillSockets(live, everySocket)`,
  `sshProject.killSessions(…, {everySocket:true})`, `transport.destroy(id, {everySocket:true})` —
  the wire legs demand a literal `true`). A destroy for a session we HOLD still fires exactly one
  kill; and the unheld branch is not rare — an ordinary node-× on a node never mounted in this
  process takes it, which is the norm after an app restart — so project deletion and every ordinary
  × stay narrow rather than inheriting the panel's blast radius. The sweep and the reaper keep their own copies of
  the socket list **on purpose**: for them the ORDER decides first-wins de-duplication, for a kill
  it means nothing.
- **The generated SSH shell is tested under a real `/bin/sh`** (`session-memory-remote.test.ts`
  against a fake host tree, same discipline as `remote-claude-usage.test.ts` and
  `canvas-control-shim.test.ts`) — and it is not ceremony: the plan's own script said `echo ##MEM`,
  which prints an **EMPTY LINE** under POSIX sh (an unquoted `#` starts a word-initial comment) and
  would have made **every healthy host report `ok:false`**. The markers are quoted for that reason,
  every section header is printed unconditionally (a missing one means the stream was cut short, not
  that the host had nothing), and the socket names + `-F` format come from the shared constants so
  the two legs cannot look at different sockets.
- **Which machine answers** is decided in `session-memory-service.ts` by OR-ing two independent
  claims of remoteness — the renderer's `remote` flag and the shell's `isRemoteProject` — because a
  source that answers "no" while momentarily uninformed (index not loaded, master just dropped)
  would turn a remote query into a LOCAL sweep and publish this machine's sessions under the host's
  name. `sshScopePredicate` answers from **identity, not liveness** (`workspaceStore.sshProjectIds()`
  — a DISCONNECTED SSH project is still someone else's machine), OR-ed with the live masters. The
  `remote` option pair is deliberately asymmetric: `run` is optional, `isRemoteProject` is
  **required** — reading-without-knowing is a compile error.
- **Surfaces.** **Desktop**: full. **Server Edition**: the service runs and the ws-bridge has a REAL
  implementation, so the pill and panel describe the machine the server is served from; an SSH scope
  answers `ok:false` (no ControlMaster injected) and says so **by identity** via `sshScopePredicate`
  rather than trusting the renderer's flag — see docs/SERVER.md, including the silent dependency on
  the boot-time `workspaceStore.load()`. **Relay tabs**: the stub answers `ok:false` and the panel
  says session memory is not available there, which is a different story from a failure. **Kanban**:
  Canvas passes `overBoard={kanbanOpen}` (the same prop `UsageIndicator` takes), raising the pill to
  z 26 over the board's opaque 25, and an open panel to 60; with the board CLOSED the open panel
  still has to clear the sessions sidebar (z 12), which is the separate
  `.sysres-indicator:has(.sessmem-panel) { z-index: 13 }` — both `:has()` rules work only because
  the pill cluster is mounted OUTSIDE `<ReactFlow>`, whose wrapper's inline `z-index: 0` would trap
  any value inside it. **Mobile**: **N/A for v1** — *nodeterm
  mobile* attaches to tmux sessions over the transport protocol and has no per-session host-memory
  concept; adding one means extending that protocol (follow-up in the iOS repo).

**Offscreen release makes the macOS reaper bug far more visible, and the two shipped days apart.**
A node released while offscreen detaches its PTY client — so it becomes a DETACHED tmux session and
joins the reaper's candidate pool once past the 6 h grace. On a Mac reading `os.freemem()` the
watermark was permanently tripped, so those sessions were culled on the next sweep. More automatic
detaching + an always-true pressure signal is why the symptom read as "my sessions keep
disappearing" rather than as an occasional cull. The `vm_stat` reader is what makes the pool safe
again; the grace window was never the thing that was wrong.


## Keybindings (registry, overrides, dispatch)

Every user-facing chord is a registry command, and the whole engine is **one module**:
`src/shared/keybindings.ts` holds the command registry, per-command validation
(`normalizeBindingForCommand`), effective-binding resolution, conflict detection, override
sanitization and the pure event→command resolver. **Do not split it** — main, the renderer and the
Server Edition bridge all import it, and a second copy of any of those five is how the dispatcher,
the Settings section and ShortcutsPanel start disagreeing about what a chord means.

- **Overrides live in `settings.keybindings`** (hand-editable JSON): an absent id = the registry
  default, `[]` = **disabled**, a list = exactly those chords. It is **sanitized at READ**
  (`sanitizeKeybindingOverrides` → `renderer/lib/keybindingOverrides.ts`, memoized on the raw
  object's identity), which is what makes a hand-edited file safe; the Settings section refuses a
  bad candidate BEFORE saving (`commitCandidate`) so the user learns which chord was refused
  instead of watching it vanish on the next launch. The write path is raw and the gates read the
  sanitized map, so a dropped hand-edit is invisible in the UI but still on disk until a UI write
  or Reset replaces the map.
- **Dispatch has exactly two owners.** The renderer's is ONE window `keydown` listener in
  `Canvas.tsx`, on the **bubble** phase — the Settings recorder's `stopPropagation` on an armed
  capture depends on that, and moving it to capture would let a recorded chord fire the command it
  is being bound to. The main process's is `src/main/keydown-intercept.ts`, a **closed allowlist**
  of chords it must steal back from the application menu before the page ever sees them.
- **Invariants**
  - **Never read `settings.speech.shortcut`.** The dictation chord is `dictationBinding()` (the
    first effective `speech.dictation` binding); the legacy field is a **downgrade mirror only**,
    written by `setKeybindingOverride` so an older build still finds the user's chord.
  - **`isHoldChord('')` is TRUE** (an all-false parse has a null key), and `''` is what a DISABLED
    dictation binding reads as — so every caller owes an explicit `=== ''` check first. Without it
    a disabled binding arms a modifier-less hold chord that fires on any keydown.
  - **`MAIN_INTERCEPTED_COMMAND_IDS` must mirror the registry-backed commands `keydown-intercept.ts`
    actually resolves** (`keydown-intercept.test.ts` pins it). The Settings UI's app-wide shadow
    warning reads that list and cannot derive it — main is not importable from the renderer. Note
    what the pin cannot cover: a HARDCODED intercept (the `Digit0` branch) has no command id, so it
    swallows its chord app-wide with the recorder reporting no conflict.
  - **Dictation has its own conflict bucket** (`conflictBucket` — `speech.dictation` is never in
    `global`), because it never competes at dispatch: the resolver skips it and its own keyed
    listener claims the chord FIRST **in plain app focus only**, which is precedence, not ambiguity.
    Overlap policy is deliberately asymmetric — the LOAD path PERMITS a shared chord (legacy
    settings.json files contain them and `sanitizeKeybindingOverrides` would otherwise strip the
    user's own binding with the migrated one), while the Settings UI REFUSES to create one
    (`commitCandidate`'s two dictation gates, both keyed-only — a modifier-only hold chord renders
    as `…:(hold)` and can never match a keyed identity).
  - **The terminal-first stand-down is `policyStandsDown(policy, terminalFocused)`, and both halves
    are refusals.** `settings.terminalShortcutPolicy` (`app-first` default, Settings → Keyboard
    Shortcuts, read everywhere through `normalizeTerminalShortcutPolicy` because it is
    hand-editable) never stands anything down under `app-first`, whatever the mirror reports — that
    is the byte-identical guarantee for a user who never touched it. Under `terminal-first` with a
    focused terminal, main stops claiming its chords AND disables the command-style menu items in
    `menuItemIdsToSuspend` — Minimize, Toggle Kanban Board (⌘⇧B) and Settings (⌘,) everywhere, plus
    Close off-mac, with **Reload deliberately excluded** (see **Window chrome**): not calling
    `preventDefault` alone would hand ⌘M straight to `{role:'minimize'}`, which is strictly worse
    than having no policy. **The MENU's state is the composed
    `menuStandsDown(shortcutRecording, policy, terminalFocused)`** — an armed shortcut recorder
    suspends the same items, so ⌘M / ⌘⇧B / ⌘, / off-mac Ctrl+W reach the recorder instead of the
    menu item that owns them; `menuStandsDown(false, …)` is `policyStandsDown(…)` by construction.
    The two INTERCEPT thunks stay independent parameters — only the menu ORs them.
    **The CLOSE leg has one extra, policy-independent stand-down** (issue #383, off-mac only):
    `closeStandsDownInTerminal(isMac, terminalFocused)` — off-mac `node.close`'s default chord is
    Ctrl+W, readline's kill-word, so while a terminal has focus the close intercept lets the chord
    fall through UNTOUCHED and `syncMenuForStandDown` disables the Close menu item on top of the
    shared list. mac's ⌘W is deliberately unaffected (not a shell key), and ⌘/Ctrl+M and ⌘/Ctrl+0
    keep firing — this is one chord whose terminal meaning outranks its app meaning, not a policy
    change. One predicate, two consumers, pinned in `keydown-intercept.test.ts` (including a
    source-level wiring pin, since the menu leg lives against a real Menu in index.ts).
  - **`terminalFocused` is a MIRROR, and its fail-safe direction is `false` = not focused =
    intercepts ON.** `renderer/lib/terminalFocusMirror.ts` reports focus changes to main and is
    change-deduped (it never re-asserts), so a page that died mid-report, a reload, or a window that
    never had one all resolve to intercepts on — never to "off with nothing alive to turn them back
    on". Consequence: clear the bit ONLY where the renderer's DOCUMENT is ending (window `closed`,
    `render-process-gone`, main-frame navigation). Clearing it under a live page that is still
    focused on its terminal strands mirror and main out of sync with no event that can reconcile
    them, and the policy is dead until the user clicks away and back.

## Canvas interaction & panels (`Canvas.tsx` is the hub)

- **Context menus** (`components/ContextMenu.tsx`, portal, icons from `components/icons.tsx`):
  pane right-click = add nodes at cursor (terminal / Claude / sticky / open file) + select
  all + fit + **Tidy canvas** (`arrangeAllNodes` — packs every top-level node, including group
  frames as rigid units, into a non-overlapping grid via `arrangeNodes`, sorted by current
  (y, x) so the pack roughly preserves reading order; mirrored in ⌘K as "Tidy canvas" and in the
  keybinding registry as `canvas.tidy` (default ⌘/Ctrl+Shift+A, remappable); both
  hidden below 2 top-level nodes, where it could only be a visual no-op that still writes
  `project.json`) + restart-idle-agents (the bulk in-place agent restart, mirrored in ⌘K; both
  hidden when the canvas holds no restartable agent node, where they could only report "0
  restarted");
  node/selection right-click = group, color, duplicate, align-to-grid, collapse,
  markdown-view (terminals), refresh-terminal (terminals — bumps `respawnNonce`: fresh PTY attach
  to the SAME tmux session; manual recovery for a stuck/unpainted terminal, and the same action
  sits in the node header as `term-node__refresh` since a dead view is a bad place to hunt for a
  right-click; nothing running is interrupted), restart-agent
  (single agent node — the in-place CLI restart above; absent for a CLI we cannot quit + resume,
  disabled with a hint while the session is busy or has no id yet), delete. Actions live
  in `Canvas.tsx`, operate on `targetIds`. The non-destructive rows are user-hideable from
  **Settings → Appearance** ("Node menu items" / "Terminal header buttons"), stored as HIDDEN
  lists in `settings.hiddenNodeMenuItems` / `settings.hiddenHeaderButtons` (empty = everything
  shows). `lib/ui-visibility.ts` owns the two inventories and `isHidden`, which only answers for
  ids it knows — so Delete, restart-agent, branch/transfer, terminal Search and Close can never
  be hidden, whatever settings.json says. The group-frame menu's colors strip answers to the same
  `colors` id; builders run through `tidySeparators` so a hidden row leaves no dangling rule.
- **Add menu** = bottom dock (`Dock.tsx`) `+`, mirrored by the pane menu and command palette.
- **Undo/redo**: debounced snapshot of the nodes array on settle (drag/edit), `pastRef`/
  `futureRef` stacks, ⌘Z / ⌘⇧Z + dock buttons. History resets per project load; skipped
  while typing in inputs/terminals.
- **Selection/pan**: box-select on left-drag (`SelectionMode.Partial` — touch to select);
  pan = middle-drag or trackpad two-finger (`panOnScroll`, `zoomOnScroll:false`); pinch
  zoom. Right mouse is free for the context menu.
- **Delete** (Delete/Backspace) opens `ConfirmDialog` before removing selected nodes.
- **Zoom chords** (`renderer/lib/zoomShortcut.ts`): **⌘/Ctrl+0 → `zoomTo100`** (actual size — what
  the browser AND Electron's default View menu already mean by that key) and **Shift+1 → `fitAll`**
  (the Figma/tldraw/Excalidraw "zoom to fit"). Matched on `e.code`, like the project-jump chord,
  which excludes `Digit0` so the two can never collide. The module is a PURE decision because both
  chords move the camera and a camera move here is not read-only — `onMove` → `markDirty` persists
  the viewport and casts it to the team session — so it refuses while the kanban board is up and
  while focus is in a text surface (input/textarea/contenteditable/Monaco/xterm, where Shift+1 is
  just the `!` key), and on auto-repeat (both actions animate; a held chord would restart the tween).
  Desktop ⌘0 does NOT arrive as a keydown: the default menu's `resetZoom` accelerator wins, so
  `main/index.ts` intercepts it in `before-input-event` and forwards `app:zoom-actual-size`, which
  re-asks the same refusals. Server Edition needs no intercept (no menu; Chrome/Firefox hand ⌘0 to
  the page) and stubs the subscription.
- **"Go to node" (`goToNode`)** — the one camera-travel path (notification click, sessions
  sidebar, ⌘K jump, presence travel, minimap double-click, double-click focus). It frames the node
  with `fitView({nodes:[{id}]})` **only when React Flow has MEASURED it**: `getFitViewNodes` filters
  the fit set by `measured` (no `width`/`height` fallback in there), so an unmeasured node leaves the
  set EMPTY, its bounds collapse to `{0,0,0,0}` and the camera lands on the canvas **ORIGIN** at max
  zoom — empty canvas, node off-screen. That is the state every node is in for the first tick after
  its project loads, which is why **cross-project** focus (the load and the focus happen in the same
  tick, and measuring can lose the race — heavier canvas = more likely) used to land on nothing and
  only work on a second try. `renderer/lib/nodeFocus.ts` computes the identical framing from the
  node's PERSISTED size for that window (`nodeFitRect` resolves the group-parent chain →
  `viewportForRect` → `setViewport`), and the measured check reads React Flow's **store**
  (`getInternalNode`), not our node object — `measured` reaches our state one render later (via
  `onNodesChange`), so our copy lies about nodes the store has long sized. Unknowable size ⇒ the
  camera **stands still**; never fall back to a bare `fitView` there, that IS the origin jump.
- **Breadcrumb trail** (`renderer/lib/breadcrumbs.ts` — all the pure logic lives there) — every
  deliberate `goToNode` landing records a `NavStop` ({nodeId, at, note}) for the ACTIVE project, and
  **Cmd+[ / Cmd+]** (`canvas.goBack` / `canvas.goForward`, bound in `shared/keybindings.ts`) plus the
  two Dock buttons walk that trail; on a project activation a once-per-app-run **`ResumeCard`** offers
  the last few distinct stops ("resume where you left off") — **opt-in via
  `settings.showResumeCard` (Settings → Appearance, default OFF)**: while disabled the
  once-per-app-run slot is not spent, so enabling it later still shows the card on the next
  activation; the chords/Dock buttons work regardless. Load-bearing facts:
  - **The trail is MACHINE-LOCAL and rides `IndexEntryV3.breadcrumbs`, never `.nodeterm/project.json`** —
    the same tier as `viewport` / `defaultAccountId` / `capabilityAck`, for the same reason: a repo must
    not carry one person's camera history to everyone who clones it. `fileToProject` therefore ignores a
    `breadcrumbs` field found in the shared file (a forgery), and `projectToFile` never writes one.
  - **The cursor is not persisted either.** Only `list` rides the entry; `BreadcrumbState.index` is
    renderer-only and resets to the tip on activation. A step records no breadcrumb and rewrites no
    `project.json` — the only persistence it triggers is the ordinary `onMove` viewport persist
    (machine-local, same as any camera move; see the Zoom-chords bullet).
  - **Cap 20** (`BREADCRUMB_CAP`, oldest dropped) and a **3 s dedupe** (`BREADCRUMB_DEDUPE_MS`, so a
    re-triggered focus on the already-current node is a no-op — `recordBreadcrumb` returns the SAME
    object, which is the caller's skip test). Recording past a back-step drops the forward tail, exactly
    like a browser tab.
  - **`stepBreadcrumb` skips stops whose node is gone** (never lands on a dead entry; no reachable stop
    ⇒ `null` ⇒ the camera stands still), and `goToNode` **refuses to record ephemeral `subagent` / `loop`
    nodes**: they are merged into the `<ReactFlow nodes>` prop but never persisted (cleared on the next
    turn), so a breadcrumb for one is an id nothing can ever resolve, burning a slot forever.
  - The `note` is a **snapshot** taken at record time (agent nodes reuse the sessions sidebar's own
    `sessionStatusKind` + `STATE_LABEL` phrasing, preferring session name → node title → agent label), so
    a later state change never retroactively rewrites history.
  - **Surfaces:** Server Edition works as-is (shared renderer code + `WorkspaceStore`, which both
    shells boot — no new bridge member); mobile is N/A (no canvas, no camera); the kanban board is
    likewise N/A, and a project that activates ON the board neither shows nor spends its
    once-per-run resume card (it would sit invisible under the opaque overlay).
- **Command palette** (`CommandPalette.tsx`): ⌘/Ctrl+K; `Canvas.buildCommands` (create,
  switch project, jump to node by title/tag, open file…).
**The sessions list marks the CANVAS SELECTION** (`SessionRowVM.selected` → `.ss-row.is-active`,
2026-08-28). `.ss-row.is-active` existed in `styles.css` from the start but **nothing ever set the
class on a row** — `is-active` reached only `.ss-tab` and `.ss-group` — so the list never showed
which agent you were looking at, and a dead rule read as a working feature to everyone who grepped
it. Selection rides the existing `liveActiveNodes` memo (which already recomputes on every `nodes`
change, so carrying `n.selected` is free) and is therefore **only ever true for the ACTIVE
project**: every other project's rows come from the serialized store, which holds no selection.
That asymmetry is correct — one canvas, one selection — so do not "fix" it by persisting selection.
Accepted edge (consort, ACKNOWLEDGED not fixed): during the documented one-render project-switch
window React Flow still holds the OUTGOING project's nodes while `activeProjectId` is already the
incoming one, so a selected row can flash under the wrong project header for a frame. Cosmetic and
self-correcting on the next render; guarding it would mean threading ownership through the memo.

- **Explorer** (`ExplorerPanel.tsx`, 🗂 / ⌘⇧E): lazy file tree of the active project `cwd`
  (`fs:list`); click a file → opens an editor node; right-click → Copy Path / Reveal /
  **New File… / New Folder…** (empty-area right-click targets the root; SSH projects create on the
  host). Canvas pane right-click and ⌘K also expose **New file…** (creates under the project cwd,
  opens an editor node). These use `mkdir` + `exists` added to `FsApi`/`SshFsApi` across
  desktop/server/SSH (`core/fs-ops.ts`, `main/ssh-fs.ts`; relay remote-fs degrades to `false`).
  Expanded dirs **persist per project** across drawer close + app restart (`state/explorer.ts`
  zustand store, localStorage `nodeterm.explorerExpanded`). The header pin docks it like the
  sessions sidebar (`lib/explorerPin.ts`, `nodeterm.explorerPinned`, default off): overlay
  click-outside closes the modal only, and a pinned overlay is `pointer-events: none` so it
  cannot steal canvas clicks. × is a transient hide and does not clear the pin. Pinned z-index
  is 26 so the tree stays visible on the kanban board with the controls cluster. Desktop +
  Server Edition (personal `localStorage`). Mobile companion: N/A — no explorer there. Source
  Control stays a modal.
- **Source Control** (`main/git-service.ts` system `git` + `gh`, `SourceControlPanel.tsx`,
  ⎇): file-level **stage/unstage** (+/−), **discard**, click a file → **diff node**,
  **branch switch/create**, commit (message box at top) + push / sync / publish, **gh
  sign-in** banner (runs `gh auth login` in a new terminal via `initialCommand`), recent
  commits. **AI commit message** (✦ Generate) and **AI terminal naming** both use
  `main/commit-message.ts`: a BYO local agent CLI (claude/codex/custom) spawned read-only on
  the staged diff / captured terminal output (no built-in model); agent + extra prompt in
  Settings. The panel operates on a **selected scope**, not on the project cwd — see Worktrees.
  **Open latency + reopen**: `status()` must never await `gh auth status` — it hits the GitHub
  API (~700ms) and used to hold the panel's first paint hostage; `ghAuthedSwr()` returns the
  cached answer and refreshes in the background (the accurate `ghAuthed()` is still awaited on
  the publish flow). Status/history live in the per-cwd `state/scmCache.ts` store (same pattern
  as `scmDraft`), so the close→reopen cycle paints the last-known data instantly while the
  mount refresh replaces it silently — do not move them back into component `useState`.
- **Worktrees** (bound to **group frames**) — a git worktree binds to a group node
  (`data.worktree: GroupWorktree {repoPath, branch, baseRef, path, createdByApp}`, persisted), and
  every node created inside that frame inherits the worktree path as its `cwd`
  (`cwdForNewNodeIn`) — the frame *is* the binding, so an agent per branch is just a group per
  branch. Creation is **one step** — **"New worktree…"** from the pane menu / command palette /
  Source Control — with the repo resolved from the project cwd via `git.repoRoot()` and existing
  worktrees listed for adoption. (Both git IPCs existed before this feature and had **zero**
  renderer callers, which is why it was unusable: the dialog's repo field was always empty and had
  to be typed by hand. Don't re-strand them.)
  - **Default location** — `settings.worktreePathTemplate` is a machine-global Behavior setting,
    expanded only by `shared/worktree.computeWorktreePath` for both the dialog and canvas-control
    CLI. It is relative to the repo root and supports `$repoName` (`$reponame` /
    `$defaultFolderName` aliases) and `$branch` in bare or `${…}` form. If branch is omitted, its
    safe slug is appended automatically. The shipped `../${repoName}.worktrees/${branch}` keeps
    worktrees beside — not nested inside — the main checkout. There is no general project-settings
    surface today, so the setting is intentionally global rather than hidden in a one-off menu.
  - **One store, one poller** — `renderer/state/worktrees.ts` is the **only** caller of the worktree
    /status *read* IPCs (`git.repoRoot`, `git.worktreeList`, `git.status`); the group chip, the
    creation dialog and the Source Control panel all read that store. Three independent pollers would
    triple the `git` subprocess load and drift out of sync. It is **epoch-guarded** (a project switch
    bumps the epoch, so a stale in-flight refresh can never overwrite the newer project's
    `repoRoot`/orphans — worktrees are *created* under `repoRoot` and orphans are offered for
    *deletion*) and **fails open**. Exactly **two** direct `git.status` reads live outside it, both in
    `Canvas.tsx` and both deliberate: the one-shot probes on the **Remove** confirm (the dirty-file
    count in the warning) and on **↪ Move into worktree** (staleness only arrives by poll, so the
    directory is re-checked immediately before an irreversible session kill). Anything recurring
    belongs in the store.
  - **Scoped Source Control** — the panel operates on a selected `ScmScope` (the main checkout or a
    bound worktree). A worktree scope's **id is its group node id**, which is what lets the canvas
    selection preselect it. `scmScopes` / `defaultScmScope` / `selectedScmGroupId`
    (`shared/scm-scope.ts`) decide the list and the default. The panel derives its `cwd` **once** so
    its ~49 call sites follow — and every Canvas callback it invokes (`onOpenDiff`,
    `onOpenCommitDiff`, `onExplainCommit`, `onRunInTerminal`) must take the **scope's** cwd, never
    the project's.
  - **Reconciliation** (`shared/worktree-reconcile.ts`) — bindings are reconciled against `git
    worktree list`: a worktree deleted outside the app makes its group **stale** (chip reads
    "· missing", Merge/Remove hide, ↪ hides, and nothing spawns into the dead path — Unbind is the
    only action, and it takes the dead cwd off the children with it); a worktree bound to no group
    is an **orphan**, recoverable from the creation dialog.
  - **Two non-obvious facts the code depends on — do not "simplify" these away:**
    1. `git worktree list --porcelain` **keeps listing a worktree whose directory was deleted
       behind git's back**, tagging it `prunable` — and that tag only exists on **git ≥ 2.36**. So
       `worktreeList` additionally **stats** each path through an injected `pathExists` seam
       (`prunable: e.prunable || !pathExists(path)`; `git-service` wires `fs.existsSync`), or the
       whole stale/orphan story silently fails on the Server Edition's own target platform (Debian 11
       / Ubuntu 20.04 ship git 2.30).
    2. **A failed git read is never evidence of absence.** `listWorktrees` returns `{ok, entries}`
       so "git failed" (spawn EAGAIN, NFS hiccup, corrupt index) stays distinguishable from "git
       listed nothing" — a transient failure must never be read as "the worktree is gone", at any
       layer (`ok:false` changes no facts). Staleness from the status poll likewise needs **two
       consecutive** failed reads (`WORKTREE_STALE_STRIKES`), and the streak is scoped per project
       so a there-and-back tab switch cannot forget it.
  - **Destructive safety** — `createdByApp` gates removal: nodeterm deletes only worktrees it
    created; one the user merely **adopted** unbinds by default, and deleting its directory is an
    explicit opt-in that **defaults to off** (its branch is kept either way).
    `isDangerousWorktreeRemovalPath` refuses a path that is the repo, `$HOME`, `/`, or an ancestor
    of any of them, on **every** removal path. **Merge** always confirms — it merges into the base's
    *working tree* (`decideMergeStrategy`: merge in the base's checkout when it is clean, else a
    `fetch . branch:base` when the base is checked out nowhere, else blocked) — and its push to
    `origin/<base>` is disclosed in that dialog and **opt-in, default off**: a push to origin cannot
    be politely undone.
  - **Every path that drops a bound group goes through unbind** — Unbind, Remove, **Ungroup** and
    **Delete** all route through `releaseWorktreeBinding`, the one place that knows what a dropped
    binding owes: `displacedByWorktree`'s descendants (terminals whose cwd sits inside the
    worktree) get that cwd taken off them, and git's registration gets a `pruneOnly` prune. Ungroup
    and group-delete *keep* the children, so skipping this left a **dead cwd persisted in
    `project.json`** — invisible until a reboot cold-starts the terminal into a directory that is not
    there — and left a stale registration that makes a later `worktree add` at the same path fail.
  - **SSH projects: not supported in v1** — every affordance is shown **disabled with that reason**
    (a silently-missing row teaches nothing). The gate asks whether the node is a **remote session**
    (`data.ssh` / `data.sshRemoteTmux`) or the project is an SSH project — **not** `data.remote`,
    which only *relay* nodes carry: guarding the wrong field let a live remote tmux session be
    killed into a local path that does not exist on the host (`isRemoteSessionNode` asks about all
    three). The ops themselves **refuse** a remote repo (`git-service.isRemoteRepo`, via
    `resolveGitRemote`) rather than guess: the `git` executor routes over the project's ControlMaster
    while `pathExists` is a **local** `fs.existsSync`, so answering would stat the wrong machine and
    report *everything is gone* — a refusal is a plain failed op and, crucially, never `worktreeGone`,
    so nothing is destroyed on a bad guess. Real support needs the worktree path to derive from the
    connection's cached `remoteHome` and `pathExists` to stat the **remote** fs (a `test -e` over the
    ControlMaster).
  - **Mobile companion: not applicable in v1** (the three-surfaces call, made deliberately). A
    worktree binds to a **group frame** on the canvas, and *nodeterm mobile* (separate repo, `nodeterm-ios`)
    has no canvas — it attaches to tmux sessions over the `TerminalTransport` protocol, which carries
    no group/binding concept at all. So there is nothing to degrade gracefully: a worktree's terminals
    are ordinary tmux sessions and mobile already reaches them, it simply cannot see that they belong
    to a worktree. Surfacing the binding (a read-only "worktree: <branch>" label per session, say)
    would mean extending the transport protocol — a **follow-up in the iOS repo**, not this branch.
    Creation/merge/remove stay desktop+server only: they are destructive git operations, and a phone
    is the last place to confirm one.
  - **Known follow-up** — the Explorer tree and the ⌘K file index stay scoped to the **project cwd**,
    so a bound worktree's files are not browsable/searchable from them (its terminals and editor
    nodes work fine). Deliberately out of scope here: both index a single root, and making them
    scope-aware is the same "which checkout am I looking at?" question Source Control already answers
    with `ScmScope` — that is the seam to reuse when it is built.
- **Kanban view** (`components/kanban/KanbanView.tsx`; toggle is a Trello-style icon ON the
  **active project tab** (`.tab__board-toggle`, after the name, before the caret — the view
  belongs to the project; earlier homes were the tab-strip end, then the controls-cluster,
  both rejected in use) plus ⌘⇧B / ⌘K): per-project
  full-page board OVER the canvas. It is **dual-source** (PR #90): SESSION cards are the project's
  session nodes (React Flow type `terminal`), derived LIVE from the canvas nodes
  (title/color/kind/agentId), with RUNNING / NEEDS YOU badges + unread dot from the default
  `agentStatus` store (click = back to canvas + `focusNodeById`); GITHUB cards are the repo's
  issues (`GitHubIssueCardView` via `state/githubIssues.ts`, opened through
  `GitHubIssueSummaryModal`, a column move that closes/reopens the issue confirms first). A
  **source filter** (`KanbanSourceFilter`: All / GitHub / Sessions) and a transient per-board
  **label filter** narrow what shows. **Labels** are a per-project palette (`ProjectKanban` labels,
  edited inline via the Notion-style `LabelPicker`: create/assign/rename/recolor/delete through the
  pure `lib/kanban.ts` transforms) plus each GitHub issue's own labels, both filterable. The canvas stays MOUNTED under the opaque overlay (agent-status
  listeners live in Canvas.tsx; `display:none` would 0×0-resize every terminal into a tmux
  SIGWINCH), and canvas-only shortcuts (undo, ⌘T/⌘⇧C, Delete) early-return via `isKanbanOpen`.
  Board data is `project.kanban` ({columns, assignments: [{nodeId, columnId}]}, order = array
  order) in `.nodeterm/project.json` — git-shared, rides rev/mirror/watcher; absent until the
  first edit (`defaultKanban` seeds To Do / In Progress / Done). The virtual **Ungrouped**
  column (never persisted, undeletable/unrenamable, always first) holds every session with no —
  or dangling — assignment, in canvas order, so the board never opens empty. **Assignment is
  board metadata only**: drags never move canvas nodes or change groups; dead nodes' assignments
  prune lazily on each board change (`pruneAssignments`). Column delete is confirm-free (cards
  return to Ungrouped; no last-column rule — Ungrouped remains). The one shape rule is
  `validKanban` (`core/workspace-files.ts`), applied on EVERY load path — `fileToProject` AND
  `loadV3`'s inline (cwd-less) branch, which bypasses fileToProject — so a v1 `{columns, cards}`
  or hand-mangled board drops to the fresh default instead of crashing the render (view choice
  persists in localStorage, so a render throw would boot-loop). Pure transforms in
  `renderer/lib/kanban.ts`; view choice is personal (`state/viewMode.ts`, localStorage
  `nodeterm.projectView`). The board opens with a **title strip** (`.kanban-header`: project
  dot + name) whose height clears the floating controls-cluster icons — columns never sit under
  them. **Cards collapse/expand on single click** (transient state); the expanded detail row
  reuses `ContextMeter` (model + % pill, per the node header) + session chip + an ↗
  open-on-canvas button; double-click opens the node directly. Z-order contract: overlay 25 <
  `.controls-cluster` 26 (Explorer/SC/Settings stay clickable ON the board) < `.top-banners` 27
  (a mandatory-update card must not hide behind the board) < tabbar 30. An assigned session
  node shows its column as a **half-pill flush on the node's TOP edge** — see the pill sentence
  below. A card's ↗ / double-click opens the **card modal** (`components/kanban/CardModal.tsx`, body
  portal on the dialog-stack, scrim z 55, scrim/Esc close — Esc in CAPTURE phase, and an Esc
  during a header rename only cancels the edit). Terminal cards get a LIVE second view of the
  tmux session (`ModalTerminal.tsx`): the pty subscriber ledger is keyed by the composite
  `(ClientId, viewerId ?? PRIMARY)` (`core/pty-manager.ts` — **viewer identity**; viewerId is an
  optional TRAILING arg through preload/ws-bridge/LocalTransport, absent = bit-for-bit legacy, and
  a client's per-connection socket pause survives a single view's departure). The modal viewer
  seed-paints from the joiner screen (`toXtermText` transforms — raw capture-pane staircases),
  handles fresh-cold via scrollback snapshot + hint (agent auto-resume stays canvas-only), has
  deliberately no park/WebGL/hover/flow-control, and kills ONLY its own viewer on close. Sticky
  cards edit their text in the modal (live both ways).
  The modal header carries the terminal node's actions (search via `useTerminalSearch`+
  `FindBar` on the modal xterm; dictate via the same `nodeterm:dictate` event — `.dictation`
  overlay z is 60, ABOVE the modal scrim; ✦ `pty.generateName` through the modal rename funnel).
  **The 💬 icon means COMMENTS on both surfaces** (repurposed from the markdown view — ⌘M still
  toggles markdown/chat on the canvas node): on a terminal node it opens a right-side comments
  flyout (`.term-node__comments`, a sibling of the overflow:hidden root, hosting BoardLogPanel
  with `card: Pick<KanbanSession,'id'>`); in the modal it collapses/reopens the panel, which is
  OPEN BY DEFAULT there. Under the modal header sits the **card metadata strip** (`CardMetaBar.tsx`): Members (assign) —
  colored initial avatars, picker pool = me + live presence peers + board-log authors (name-keyed,
  NO separate membership system) — and a Due date (`datetime-local`, red Overdue chip past due;
  cards show mini avatars + a due chip). Data = `kanban.meta [{nodeId, assignees, dueAt, priority}]` (priority low/medium/high/urgent, colored chips)
  (tolerant readers via `cardMeta`; pruned with dead nodes; empty entries dropped). Assign/due
  changes are logged through the SAME diff funnel (`member-assigned/unassigned`, `due-set/cleared`,
  `priority-set/cleared`; agent-to-agent message deliveries are logged as `agent-message` by
  `agent-message-trace.recordDelivery`, where `from`/`to` are node ids and `title` is the outcome;
  unknown future event types render neutrally — the `BoardLogEvent.type` union in `shared/types.ts`
  is the source of truth). Feed rows show ABSOLUTE Trello-style stamps
  (relative in the tooltip). The modal's right third is the **board log** panel (`BoardLogPanel.tsx`, `state/boardLog.ts`):
  per-person comments + card activity from `<cwd>/.nodeterm/board-log.jsonl` — append-only JSONL
  (`core/board-log.ts`: tolerant newest-first parse cap 500; text clamped `BOARD_LOG_TEXT_MAX`
  16KB — an SSH append is ONE printf arg, ARG_MAX would silently drop it), author = presence
  identity, registered via `core/board-log-handlers.ts` in BOTH shells (client sends only a
  projectId — the path always derives from the server's own registry, no jail needed). Events
  come from ONE pure funnel (`lib/boardLogDiff.ts` — binding invariant: its `cardTitle` arg
  returns '' for and ONLY for dead nodes; column deletion suppresses per-card moved-to-Ungrouped
  noise; prunes/reorders log nothing) + `createNodeInColumn`'s card-created. Local projects push
  changes via fs.watch; desktop SSH projects poll 5s while subscribed; inline projects show a
  hint. Relay tabs BRIDGE boardLog to the host (pre-dispatch `sharedProjectId` scope guard in the
  relay dispatch — an out-of-scope projectId is refused before any registry/path resolution; a
  connection drop replays its outstanding onChanged unsubscribes). Deliberate v1 gaps: column-level
  events are stored but no card feed shows them; canvas-born nodes get no card-created; no
  card-deleted type.
  Per-column "+ New session" menus create agents/terminal/sticky nodes assigned to the column
  (assignment written UN-pruned — the fresh node isn't in the derived list yet). The column
  half-pill itself: (`components/kanban/ColumnPill.tsx`, `columnForNode` in lib/kanban; rendered
  as a SIBLING of the node root — the roots are overflow:hidden — hidden for Ungrouped/dangling,
  click opens the board). Server Edition works as-is (pure renderer + workspace.save). Scope: no
  agent-driven card movement yet, no board undo, mobile N/A.
- **Settings** (`SettingsPage.tsx`, ⚙ / ⌘,): font/cursor (live to xterm + Monaco), default
  shell, grid + snap, **default node size** (`defaultNodeWidth`/`defaultNodeHeight` — new
  terminal/agent nodes only, clamped in `terminalNodeSize()` in `state/workspace.ts`),
  pan-hover delay, double-click focus, accent, tmux on/scrollback, commit agent,
  `seenShortcuts`.
- **Shortcuts** (`ShortcutsPanel.tsx`, ? / ⌘/): shown once on first launch (`seenShortcuts`).
- **Welcome** (`WelcomeScreen.tsx`): shown when no projects exist.
- **Window chrome**: macOS integrated title bar (`titleBarStyle: 'hiddenInset'`); the tab
  bar (`TabBar.tsx`) is the drag region with the `nodeterm` logo + a rounded pill of project
  tabs. Cmd+M is intercepted in `main/keydown-intercept.ts` (`before-input-event`, installed from
  `main/index.ts` — else macOS minimizes) and forwarded to the renderer via `app:toggle-markdown`;
  Cmd+W (`app:close-node`) and Cmd+0 (`app:zoom-actual-size`) are taken back the same way. **The
  application menu is OURS**: `buildAppMenu` (`main/index.ts`) calls `Menu.setApplicationMenu` and
  re-runs on every settings change. (This bullet used to claim we never call it — false since that
  function landed; check the template, not Electron's defaults.) **COMMAND-style accelerators are
  handled ABOVE the page on every platform** — Minimize, Close, Toggle Kanban Board, Settings,
  Reload — so a chord one of those owns never reaches the renderer, which is why those three are
  stolen in `before-input-event`. **This is not a blanket claim about the whole menu:** the Edit
  submenu's standard `{role:'cut'|'copy'|'paste'|'selectAll'|…}` items behave differently — Chromium
  routes them into the focused element, so ⌘C in a terminal or a text field does the ordinary thing
  and does not need stealing. Ask which kind an item is before reasoning from this bullet.
  That difference is also why the **stand-down has a menu leg**: while a terminal
  owns the keys under `terminal-first` **or while a shortcut recorder is armed**
  (`menuStandsDown(shortcutRecording, policy, terminalFocused)`), `syncMenuForStandDown` disables
  the command-style items
  named in `menuItemIdsToSuspend` — Minimize (`MENU_ITEM_ID_MINIMIZE`), **Toggle Kanban Board
  (`MENU_ITEM_ID_KANBAN`, ⌘⇧B)** and **Settings (`MENU_ITEM_ID_SETTINGS`, ⌘,)** on every platform,
  plus Close (`MENU_ITEM_ID_CLOSE`) on Windows/Linux — because a disabled item suppresses its
  accelerator and only then do those chords fall through to the terminal, or to the recorder.
  Off-mac the Close item is ALSO disabled whenever a terminal has focus, policy or no policy
  (`closeStandsDownInTerminal`, issue #383): its role owns the Ctrl+W accelerator, and that
  keystroke in a shell is readline's kill-word. The
  recorder leg is why ⌘M is bindable at all, and it fixed a live misfire: ⌘⇧B pressed into an armed
  recorder used to open the kanban board behind the Settings dialog, and ⌘, to re-open Settings.
  Kanban and Settings are
  the ones a reader gets wrong: they are **not** intercepted chords at all but ordinary registry
  commands (`view.kanbanToggle` / `app.settings`), so the renderer's dispatcher could never stand
  them down itself — under app-first the menu takes them before the keydown exists, which is also
  why their capture NOTICE is raised at the IPC receivers in `Canvas.tsx` rather than by the
  dispatcher. **Reload (⌘R / ⌘⇧R) is the named exception and stays live while stood down**: it is
  the crash-recovery lever (a wedged renderer is exactly when it is needed) and a main-frame
  navigation is one of the three sites that reset `terminalFocused` / `shortcutRecording`. **Of the
  items main suspends, Reload is therefore the deliberate exception** — the one it holds back from a
  shortcut recorder — which is what the Keyboard Shortcuts section's description now says.
  **KNOWN GAP, pre-existing and accepted:** the suspend list only ever covered the command-style
  items the terminal-first policy needed, so the always-on app roles — `quit` (⌘Q), `hide` /
  `hideOthers` (⌘H / ⌘⌥H), `toggleDevTools`, `togglefullscreen` — still act while a recorder is
  armed (⌘Q pressed into one QUITS the app). They are deliberately NOT added: ONE list drives both
  stand-downs, and making ⌘Q/⌘H unreachable for a terminal-first user is the worse trade — quit and
  hide must never be policy-gated. Splitting the list per stand-down is the change that would close
  it, and it has not been made.
  `keydown-intercept.test.ts` pins both the stolen chords and the suspended item ids (including
  that the list does not silently grow) — `getMenuItemById` answers `null` for a typo and the
  fail-safe is to do nothing, which is indistinguishable from the feature working.
- **Theme**: macOS dark palette as CSS tokens in `styles.css` `:root` (`--accent` = systemBlue,
  label/separator opacities, SF font stack). Canvas background is black with dot grid.

## Remote access (phone relay) — free, not Pro

- Phone relay remote access ("Reach this Mac from anywhere") is a **Core (free) feature** as of
  2026-08-01 — the iOS app is itself paid, so a desktop Pro gate double-charged the same feature.
  The former Pro gate AND the free-tier monthly quota (`core/relay-quota.ts`, `RelayQuotaBanner`,
  the ProCompare meter, the `relayQuota` IPC/preload/bridge surface, docs/relay-quota.md) were all
  **removed**. The toggle (`settings.phoneAccessEnabled`, Settings → Phone + quick-pair popover)
  shows for everyone; the standing host reconciles on `enabled && relayAllowed()` alone, with no
  quota metering at `onPeerReady`. **Entitlement passthrough remains**: a stored Pro entitlement is
  sent on mints, else the `{deviceId,…}` body (host-token `{deviceId, hostPublicKeyB64}`, device
  mint `{deviceId, hostDeviceId, hostPublicKeyB64, label}`). **The backend is the real gate now**:
  `POST /v1/relay/host-token` / `/v1/relay/device` must admit deviceId (no-entitlement) mints, and
  the relay server may rate-limit free hosts independently — a client-side gate must NOT be
  reintroduced to work around a backend refusal (fix the backend policy instead).

## Speech / dictation (desktop + server)

Voice-to-text input captured via microphone, turned into terminal text via on-device Whisper. Works on desktop (Electron) and Server Edition (browser); iOS support is separate (`nodeterm-ios`, private — see the three-surfaces entry under Conventions).

- **Service seam** (`src/core/speech/`) — `SpeechService` (core) + `PlatformSpeechProvider` interface + shell implementations (`PlatformElectron` / `PlatformServer`). Models are stored under `${dataDir}/speech-models/`, with fenced downloads + orphan sweep (`removeUnusedModels`). Core validates license: **tiny** free (always); **base·small·large-v3-turbo** Pro (via `isPremium()`). One model loaded at a time (FIFO memory management), lazy smart-whisper import degrades to a friendly error if the native dep is unavailable (`"Local whisper is unavailable…"`).
- **Cloud contract (iOS parity)** — `/v1/transcribe` multipart endpoint (not built yet; SDK `transcribe()` call matches iOS byte-for-byte) for future remote transcription. IPC channels `speech:*` (in `src/shared/ipc.ts`) wired in **both** Electron and Server: `speech:transcribe` (returns `Promise<{text}>`), `speech:models`, `speech:model-download`, `speech:model-delete`, `speech:progress` (main/server → renderer download-progress broadcast), and `speech:mic-consent` (Electron mic-prompt only, server always true). There is no `speech:synthesize` / `speech:cancel` and no audio in the reply.
- **Renderer capture** — `PcmCapture` AudioWorklet (16kHz single-channel PCM, WebAudio or fallback SPN) + DictationOverlay (⌘⇧D dock mic / Cmd key; Settings → Speech section for model choice + progress). **Send** appends text + Enter to the terminal; **Insert** sends text-only via `sendText(…, {enter: false})`. **Nothing auto-submits** (user always decides when to send).
- **Browser constraints** — `getUserMedia` requires HTTPS or `localhost`; mic permission prompt is the browser's own (not handled by nodeterm). Model downloads land on the **server's data dir** (accessible across sessions).
- **Electron + native dep** — smart-whisper is externalized + `asarUnpack`'d (not bundled); `postinstall` rebuilds it against Electron's ABI. Device verification of the ABI rebuild is not yet exercised on a dev machine — test paths exist but have not been run in CI.

## Packaging & auto-update

Built with **electron-builder** (config in the `package.json` `build` block: appId
`com.nodeterm.app`, productName `nodeterm`, mac dmg+zip for arm64 **and** x64, `asarUnpack`
node-pty, output `dist/`). The app icon is generated from the nodeterm mark by
`scripts/make-icon.mjs` (sharp → `build/icon.png` 1024² + multi-resolution `build/icon.ico`
for Windows, both gitignored — regenerated by `make-icon`, which every dist script runs first);
the same script hand-packs `build/icon.icns` (size-checked frames — issue #369) and `build/icon.ico`, which electron-builder embeds as-is. Scripts: `npm run make-icon`, `npm run dist`
(local **unsigned** arm64 `.dmg` smoke test), `npm run dist:win` (unsigned x64 NSIS installer +
zip, `--publish never`). Production release signing/notarization and the update-feed hosting are
handled outside this repo.

**Windows packaging is GROUNDWORK, not a shippable app** (extracted from external PR #276; a
Windows build is unusable until the session-host phase merges). Deliberate decisions: the target
is **NSIS via electron-builder** — the fork switched to Squirrel.Windows
(`electron-builder-squirrel-windows` + an 800-line `windows-installer.mjs` wrapper + its own
update feed), but our pipeline is electron-builder end-to-end and NSIS is built in, needs no
extra dependency, and is what electron-updater's generic provider expects on Windows — so
Squirrel was not adopted. Builds are **unsigned** (no Windows cert; electron-builder skips
signing when no cert env is present). `bootstrap-windows.bat` (repo root) takes a fresh Windows
machine to a built checkout: it verifies Node ≥ 20 / VS Build Tools C++ / Python 3 with exact
winget hints (it never installs machine-wide tools itself, and refuses to run elevated) and runs
`npm ci`. `.github/workflows/win-package-smoke.yml` is a **workflow_dispatch-only** packaging
smoke on windows-latest — build only, never publishes. **Follow-ups, in order:** Windows
auto-update wiring (electron-updater NSIS leg + `latest.yml` on the nodeterm.dev feed — blocked
on signing: an unsigned auto-update is a downgrade in trust), a release.yml Windows job, and the
fork's PE-identity polish (electron-builder leaves `OriginalFilename` empty; the fork's
`resedit`-based afterSign hook fixes it — cosmetic for NSIS, load-bearing only for Squirrel).

Auto-update uses **electron-updater** (`src/main/updater.ts`, `initUpdater(onBeforeRestart?)` from `index.ts`):
runs **only when `app.isPackaged`** (dev = no-op), checks on launch + every 6h, auto-downloads,
forwards the lifecycle (`update-available` / `download-progress` / `update-downloaded` / errors)
to the renderer over IPC. `components/UpdateCard.tsx` shows the strip + **Restart to update** →
`updates.restart()` → `autoUpdater.quitAndInstall()`; on `update-downloaded` an OS notification
also fires when the window is unfocused. Exposed via `window.nodeTerminal.updates` (`UpdateApi`).
macOS *silent* self-install requires a signed+notarized build; unsigned builds still surface
the card for a manual download.

**Backend check feed** (`src/core/check.ts`, successor to the static `announcements.json`): the
**main process** calls `GET https://api.nodeterm.dev/v1/check?version=&os=&channel=stable` (so the
renderer CSP stays `'self'`) on launch + every 6h, cached 5 min, returning `{ messages, update }`.
Exposed split over two IPC handlers: `announcements.fetch()` → `messages`, `appUpdatePolicy` →
`update`. `components/AnnouncementBanner.tsx` (stacked above `UpdateCard` under the tab bar in a
`.top-banners` column) shows the newest message the user hasn't dismissed (dismissed `id`s persist
in `localStorage`); `update.mandatory`/`minSupported` flips `UpdateCard` into a blocking required-
update state. The call no-ops under `DO_NOT_TRACK`/`NODETERM_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` or in unpackaged
builds (unless `NODETERM_API_BASE` targets a local server). Schema example:
`docs/announcements.example.json`. **Telemetry** (`src/main/telemetry.ts`) is a separate opt-out
ping to `api.nodeterm.dev/v1/ping` (version/OS on launch + daily), gated on
`settings.telemetryEnabled` + the same build/DNT guards; toggle in Settings → Privacy.

## Atomic writes (never a bare `fs.rename`)

Every store persists temp-file-then-rename. That is correct on POSIX and **silently lossy on
Windows**: `MoveFileEx` fails with `EPERM` whenever the destination is open by anyone at that
instant, and what opens a file you just wrote is Defender's real-time scanner, the search indexer,
OneDrive over a synced profile, or two of our own concurrent writers racing one destination. The
save throws and the data is gone — intermittently, unreproducibly, and **more often on the machines
that are best protected**.

`renameAtomic` / `writeFileAtomic` (`src/core/fs-atomic.ts`) retry briefly. Each attempt is still
one indivisible rename, so a retry cannot tear a write. They deliberately do NOT retry forever
(several callers report a failed save as `persisted:false`, and that contract outranks a save that
eventually lands), do not retry `ENOENT`/`ENOSPC`, do not branch on platform (or the behaviour under
test on a Mac is not the behaviour shipped to Windows), and never swallow the final error.

**Nothing in the toolchain catches the bare version.** 28 files had it, across three spellings — the user's canvas, their
settings, their sealed credentials, their pinned devices — and every one of them reads as a correct
atomic write, because on the platform most of this was written on it is one. The only signal in a
6,000-test suite was one store's overlapping-saves test, red on Windows for that store's whole life.
So it is enforced by scan: `src/core/fs-atomic.guard.test.ts` fails on any bare `fs.rename` outside
the helper. Full write-up, including the separate shared-temp-name bug at the same sites:
**`docs/atomic-writes.md`**.

SSH/scp staging follows the same ownership rule outside direct `fs` calls. Atomic remote stdin
writes use `src/main/remote-atomic-write.ts`: a bounded `.nodeterm-<uuid>.tmp` leaf is placed beside
the target BEFORE both complete paths are quoted, then the shell preserves the write/move status
while cleaning that exact temp. The temp leaf must stay independent of the target leaf — appending
`.uuid.tmp` to a valid `NAME_MAX` target makes the write impossible. It currently protects
filesystem API writes, tmux.conf, the private hook endpoint, node
tokens, agent status and pending answers; generated hook scripts/config merges still use their
existing direct writes and must not be described as atomic. Upload directories use UUIDs across app
processes. Downloads and media-cache copies use hidden UUID `.part` names; user-visible downloads
also hold an exclusive candidate lock until the rename and cleanup finish. Never simplify any of
those back to `<target>.tmp` / `<target>.part` or a read-only "does the destination exist?" check —
the overlap tests exercise the resulting race.

## Conventions

- **Two docs, two audiences — keep both.** This file holds the deep invariants with their
  reasoning and measurements; it is dense on purpose and is loaded automatically by coding agents.
  **`CONTRIBUTING.md` is the short human door**: setup, the process-boundary rules, the house rules
  that get a PR sent back, and the testing habits. When you change or discover something **other
  developers must know before touching the code** — a boundary that is now enforced, a trap that
  costs an hour to diagnose, a habit that catches a class of bug — **add it to `CONTRIBUTING.md`
  too, not only here.** An invariant that lives only in this file (or worse, only in a commit
  message) is one refactor away from being violated by a contributor who never opened it. Keep the
  split by audience, not by topic: the *why it must be this way* stays here, the *what you need to
  know before your first PR* goes there.


- Code comments, UI strings, and identifiers are all in **English**. Match this when editing.
- Path aliases: `@shared/*`, `@renderer/*` (see the tsconfig files / vite config).
- **Subagent model:** when dispatching subagents (implementers, reviewers, etc. — e.g. in
  the subagent-driven-development workflow), use the latest model, **Opus 5**
  (`claude-opus-5`). This overrides any cheaper-model defaults in a skill's model-selection
  guidance.
- **Three surfaces — design every feature for all of them.** nodeterm now ships on three
  fronts, and a feature is not "done" until you've decided how it behaves on each (even if
  the decision is "not applicable here"):
  1. **Desktop** (Electron) — the primary app (`src/main` + `src/renderer` via the preload).
  2. **Server Edition** (Linux, browser) — `src/server` + the `src/renderer/bridge` shim (see
     the `src/server/` bullet above and docs/SERVER.md).
  3. **Mobile companion** — *nodeterm mobile*, a **separate PRIVATE repo** (`nodeterm-ios`)
     — outside contributors cannot see or PR it, so a mobile implication is raised in the
     desktop PR and **@eneskirca** is mentioned to carry it over
     (SwiftUI + SwiftTerm/Citadel, tmux-integrated, talks the `TerminalTransport`/RemoteTransport
     protocol).

  **The canvas and the kanban board are TWO VIEWS of the same nodes — treat the board as a
  first-class surface, not an afterthought.** Every session/node feature you add to a canvas node
  (a header action, a context-menu item, a status badge, file drop, dictation, …) should be
  considered for the kanban **card** and its **card modal** too, so we don't keep shipping a
  feature on one view and then bolting it onto the other in a follow-up. The board already mirrors
  most of the node's surface: the card modal co-attaches the same tmux session (`ModalTerminal`),
  carries the node's actions (search / dictate / AI-name / comments), accepts file drops
  (`terminal/file-drop.ts`), renders browser webviews (`BrowserSurface`), and its cards support
  right-click actions + `+ New`. When you touch a node's UI, ask "does the board need this too?"
  and wire it through `KanbanView`/`SessionCard`/`CardModal` in the SAME change. Kanban itself is
  desktop+Server-Edition (pure renderer + `workspace.save`); the iOS board is a separate read/move
  mirror (`nodeterm-ios`, `KanbanGrouping`/`ProjectBoardView`).

  Practical rules that keep the surfaces in sync:
  - **Put new service/main-process logic in `src/core` behind `CorePlatform`, never inline in
    `src/main`.** That is the seam the Server Edition boots from — logic left in `src/main`
    silently doesn't exist on the server (the `no-electron` tests enforce the boundary, but
    they can't tell you a feature is *missing* server-side).
  - **A feature that touches `window.nodeTerminal` needs a real `src/renderer/bridge`
    implementation, not just a stub** — or a deliberate, documented graceful degrade
    (`E_UNSUPPORTED` + the affordance hidden, like the Electron-only `shell.reveal`). The
    bridge's `satisfies NodeTerminalApi` gate forces you to *declare* every member, but a
    `noopUnsub`/`unsupported` stub compiles fine while doing nothing — decide per member.
  - **Consider whether the mobile companion should surface the feature** over its
    transport/protocol. It's a different repo and stack (Swift), so this is usually a
    follow-up note rather than same-PR work — but flag it so it isn't forgotten.
  When a change is genuinely desktop-only (native menus, auto-update, Keychain), say so; the
  point is to make the call consciously, not to leave the other surfaces to rot.
